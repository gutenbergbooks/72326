SANCTUARY</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Primarily</span>, there were the conditions under which
she was brought to fifteen years of age: the crowded,
scummy tenements; the narrow green-painted halls with
their dim gas-jets, making the entrance look more like that
of a morgue than a dwelling-place; the dirty halls and rooms
with their green or blue or brown walls painted to save
the cost of paper; the bare wooden floors, long since saturated
with every type of grease and filth from oleomargarine
and suet leaked from cheap fats or meats, to beer and
whiskey and tobacco-juice. A little occasional scrubbing by
some would-be hygienic tenant was presumed to keep or
make clean some of the chambers and halls.</p>

<p>And then the streets outside—any of the streets by which
she had ever been surrounded—block upon block of other
red, bare, commonplace tenements crowded to the doors
with human life, the space before them sped over by noisy,
gassy trucks and vehicles of all kinds. And stifling in
summer, dusty and icy in winter; decorated on occasion by
stray cats and dogs, pawing in ashcans, watched over by
lordly policemen, and always running with people, people,
people—who made their living heaven only knows how,
existing in such a manner as their surroundings suggested.</p>

<p>In this atmosphere were always longshoremen, wagon-drivers,
sweepers of floors, washers of dishes, waiters, janitors,
workers in laundries, factories—mostly in indifferent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
or decadent or despairing conditions. And all of these
people existed, in so far as she ever knew, upon that mysterious,
evanescent and fluctuating something known as the
weekly wage.</p>

<p>Always about her there had been drunkenness, fighting,
complaining, sickness or death; the police coming in, and
arresting one and another; the gas man, the rent man, the
furniture man, hammering at doors for their due—and not
getting it—in due time the undertaker also arriving amid a
great clamor, as though lives were the most precious things
imaginable.</p>

<p>It is entirely conceivable that in viewing or in meditating
upon an atmosphere such as this, one might conclude that
no good could come out of it. What! a dung-heap grow
a flower? Exactly, and often, a flower—but not to grow
to any glorious maturity probably. Nevertheless a flower
of the spirit at least might have its beginnings there. And
if it shrank or withered in the miasmatic atmosphere—well,
conceivably, that might be normal, although in reality all
flowers thus embedded in infancy do not so wither. There
are flowers and flowers.</p>

<p>Viewing Madeleine Kinsella at the ages of five, seven,
eleven and thirteen even, it might have been conceded that
she was a flower of sorts—admittedly not a brave, lustrous
one of the orchid or gardenia persuasion, but a flower
nevertheless. Her charm was simpler, more retiring,
less vivid than is usually accorded the compliment of
beauty. She was never rosy, never colorful in the high
sense, never daring or aggressive. Always, from her infancy
on, she seemed to herself and others to be slipping
about the corners and out-of-the-way places of life, avoiding
it, staring at it with wide, lamblike eyes, wondering at
things, often fearfully.</p>

<p>Her face, always delicately oval and pale, was not of the
force which attracted. Her eyes, a milkish blue-gray with
a suggestion of black in the iris, her hair black, her hands
long-fingered and slim, were not of a type which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
appeal to the raw youth of her world. Unconsciously, and
ever, her slender, longish body sank into graceful poses.
Beside the hard, garish, colorful, strident types of her
neighborhoods—the girls whom the boys liked—she was
not fascinating, and yet, contemplated at odd moments as
she grew, she was appealing enough—at times beautiful.</p>

<p>What most affected her youth and her life was the internal
condition of her family, the poverty and general
worthlessness of her parents. They were as poor as their
poorest neighbors, and quarrelsome, unhappy and mean-spirited
into the bargain. Her father came dimly into
her understanding at somewhere near her seventh or eighth
year as an undersized, contentious and drunken and wordy
man, always more or less out of a job, irritated with
her mother and her sister and brother, and always, as
her mother seemed to think, a little the worse for drink.</p>

<p>“You’re a liar! You’re a liar! You’re a liar! You’re
a liar!”—how well she remembered this sing-song echoing
reiteration of his, in whatever basement or hole they were
living at the time! “You’re a liar! I never did it! You’re
a liar! I wasn’t there!”</p>

<p>Her mother, often partially intoxicated or morose because
of her own ills, was only too willing to rejoin in kind.
Her elder sister and brother, much more agreeable in their
way and as much put upon as herself, were always coming
in or running out somewhere and staying while the storm
lasted; while she, shy and always a little frightened, seemed
to look upon it all as unavoidable, possibly even essential.
The world was always so stern, so mysterious, so non-understandable
to Madeleine.</p>

<p>Again it might be, and often was, “Here, you, you brat,
go an’ get me a can o’ beer! Gwan, now!” which she did
quickly and fearfully enough, running to the nearest
wretched corner saloon with the “can” or “growler,” her
slim little fingers closed tightly over the five-cent piece or
dime entrusted to her, her eyes taking in the wonders and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
joys of the street even as she ran. She was so small at the
time that her little arms were unable to reach quite the
level of the bar, and she had to accept the aid of the bartender
or some drinker. Then she would patiently wait
while one of them teased her as to her size or until the
beer was handed down.</p>

<p>Once, and once only, three “bad boys,” knowing what she
was going for and how wretched and shabby was her father,
not able to revenge himself on any one outside his family,
had seized her en route, forced open her hand and run
away with the dime, leaving her to return fearsomely to her
father, rubbing her eyes, and to be struck and abused soundly
and told to fight—“Blank-blank you, what the hell are you
good for if you can’t do that?”</p>

<p>Only the vile language and the defensive soberness of her
mother at the time saved her from a worse fate. As for
the boys who had stolen the money, they only received
curses and awful imprecations, which harmed no one.</p>

<p>Wretched variations of this same existence were endured
by the other two members of the family, her brother Frank
and her sister Tina.</p>

<p>The former was a slim and nervous youth, given to fits
of savage temper like his father and not to be ordered and
controlled exactly as his father would have him. At times,
as Madeleine recalled, he appeared terribly resentful of the
conditions that surrounded him and cursed and swore and
even threatened to leave; at other times he was placid
enough, at least not inclined to share the dreadful scenes
which no one could avoid where her father was.</p>

<p>At the age of twelve or thirteen he secured work in a
box-factory somewhere and for a while brought his wages
home. But often there was no breakfast or dinner for him,
and when his father and mother were deep in their cups or
quarreling things were so generally neglected that even
where home ties were strong no one of any worldly experience
could have endured them, and he ran away.</p>

<p>His mother was always complaining of “the lumbago”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and of not being able to get up, even when he and Tina
were working and bringing home a portion of their weekly
wage or all of it. If she did, it was only to hover over the
wretched cookstove and brew herself a little tea and complain
as before.</p>

<p>Madeleine had early, in her ignorant and fearsome way,
tried to help, but she did not always know how and her
mother was either too ill or too disgruntled with life to
permit her to assist, had she been able.</p>

<p>As it had been with Frank so it was with Tina, only it
came sooner.</p>

<p>When Madeleine was only five Tina was a grown girl
of ten, with yellow hair and a pretty, often smiling face,
and was already working somewhere—in a candy store—for
a dollar and a half a week. Later, when Madeleine
was eight and Tina thirteen, the latter had graduated to a
button-works and was earning three.</p>

<p>There was something rather admirable and yet disturbing
connected dimly with Tina in Madeleine’s mind, an atmosphere
of rebelliousness and courage which she had never
possessed and which she could not have described, lacking
as she did a mind that registered the facts of life clearly.
She only saw Tina, pretty and strong, coming and going
from her ninth to her thirteenth year, refusing to go for
beer at her father’s order and being cursed for it, even
struck at or thrown at by him, sometimes by her
mother, and often standing at the foot of the stairs after
work hours or on a Sunday afternoon or evening, looking at
the crowded street or walking up and down with other girls
and boys, when her mother wanted her to be doing things
in the house—sweeping, washing dishes, making beds—dreary,
gray tasks all.</p>

<p>“Fixin’ your hair again! Fixin’ your hair again! Fixin’
your hair again!” she could hear her father screaming whenever
she paused before the one cracked mirror to arrange
her hair. “Always in front of that blank-blank mirror
fixin’ her hair! If you don’t get away from in front of it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
I’ll throw you an’ the mirror in the street! What the hell
are you always fixin’ your hair for? Say? What’re you
always fixin’ your hair for? Say! What? What’re you
always fixin’ your hair for?”</p>

<p>But Tina was never cast down apparently, only silent.
At times she sang and walked with an air. She dressed herself
as attractively as possible, as if with the few things she
had she was attempting to cast off the burden of the life by
which she was surrounded. Always she was hiding things
away from the others, never wanting them to touch anything
of hers. And how she had hated her father as she grew,
in bitter moments calling him a “sot” and a “fool.”</p>

<p>Tina had never been very obedient, refusing to go to
church or to do much of anything about the house. Whenever
her father and mother were drinking or fighting she
would slip away and stay with some girl in the neighborhood
that she knew. And in spite of all this squalor and
misery and the fact that they moved often and the food was
bad, Tina, once she was twelve or thirteen, always seemed
able to achieve an agreeable appearance.</p>

<p>Madeleine often remembered her in a plaid skirt she had
got somewhere, which looked beautiful on her, and a little
gilt pin which she wore at her neck. And she had a way
of doing her yellow hair high on her head, which had stuck
in Madeleine’s mind perhaps because of her father’s rude
comments on it.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>It is not surprising that Madeleine came to her twelfth
and thirteenth years without any real understanding of the
great world about her and without any definite knowledge
or skill. Her drunken mother was now more or less dependent
upon her, her father having died of pneumonia and
her brother and sister having disappeared to do for themselves.</p>

<p>Aside from petty beginners’ tasks in shops or stores, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
assisting her mother at washing or cleaning, there was little
that she could do at first. Mrs. Kinsella, actually compelled
by the need for rent or food or fuel after a time, would get
occasional work in a laundry or kitchen or at scrubbing or
window-cleaning, but not for long. The pleasure of drink
would soon rob her of that.</p>

<p>At these tasks Madeleine helped until she secured work
in a candy factory in her thirteenth year at the wage of
three-thirty a week. But even with this little money paid
in regularly there was no assurance that her mother would
add sufficient to it to provide either food or warmth. Betimes,
and when Madeleine was working, her mother
cheered her all too obvious sorrows with the bottle, and at
nights or week-ends rewarded Madeleine with a gabble
which was all the more painful because no material comfort
came with it.</p>

<p>The child actually went hungry at times. Usually, after
a few drinks, her mother would begin to weep and recite
her past ills: a process which reduced her timorous and very
sympathetic daughter to complete misery. In sheer desperation
the child sought for some new way in her own mind.
A reduction in the working-force of the candy factory, putting
her back in the ranks of the work-seekers once more,
and a neighbor perceiving her wretched state and suggesting
that some extra helpers were wanted in a department store
at Christmastime, she applied there, but so wretched were
her clothes by now that she was not even considered.</p>

<p>Then a man who had a restaurant in a nearby street gave
her mother and Madeleine positions as dishwashers, but he
was compelled to discharge her mother, although he wished
to retain Madeleine. From this last, however, because of
the frightening attentions of the cook, she had to flee, and
without obtaining a part of the small pittance which was
due her. Again, and because in times past she had aided
her mother to clean in one place and another, she was able
to get a place as servant in a family.</p>

<p>Those who know anything of the life of a domestic know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
how thoroughly unsatisfactory it is—the leanness, the lack
of hope. As a domestic, wherever she was—and she obtained
no superior places for the time being—she had only
the kitchen for her chief chamber or a cubby-hole under the
roof. Here, unless she was working elsewhere in the house
or chose to visit her mother occasionally, she was expected
to remain. Pots and pans and scrubbing and cleaning and
bed-making were her world. If any one aside from her
mother ever wanted to see her (which was rare) he or she
could only come into the kitchen, an ugly and by day
inconvenient realm.</p>

<p>She had, as she soon came to see, no privileges whatsoever.
In the morning she was expected to be up before
any one else, possibly after working late the night before.
Breakfast had to be served for others before she herself
could eat—what was left. Then came the sweeping and
cleaning. In one place which she obtained in her fifteenth
year the husband annoyed her so, when his wife was not
looking, that she had to leave; in another it was the son.
By now she was becoming more attractive, although by no
means beautiful or daring.</p>

<p>But wherever she was and whatever she was doing, she
could not help thinking of her mother and Tina and Frank
and her father, and of the grim necessities and errors and
vices which had seemed to dominate them. Neither her
brother nor her sister did she ever see again. Her mother,
she felt (and this was due to a sensitiveness and a sympathy
which she could not possibly overcome), she would have
with her for the rest of her days unless, like the others,
she chose to run away.</p>

<p>Daily her mother was growing more inadequate and less
given to restraint or consideration. As “bad” as she was,
Madeleine could not help thinking what a “hard” time she
had had. From whatever places she obtained work in these
days (and it was not often any more) she was soon discharged,
and then she would come inquiring after Madeleine,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
asking to be permitted to see her. Naturally, her
shabby dress and shawl and rag of a hat, as well as her
wastrel appearance, were an affront to any well-ordered
household. Once in her presence, whenever Madeleine was
permitted to see her, she would begin either a cozening or
a lachrymose account of her great needs.</p>

<p>“It’s out o’ oil I am, me dear,” or “Wurra, I have no
wood” or “bread” or “meat”—never drink. “Ye won’t let
yer pore old mother go cold or hungry, now, will ye?
That’s the good girl now. Fifty cents now, if ye have it,
me darlin’, or a quarter, an’ I’ll not be troublin’ ye soon
again. Even a dime, if ye can spare me no more. God’ll
reward ye. I’ll have work o’ me own to-morra. That’s the
good girl now—ye won’t let me go away without anything.”</p>

<p>Oscillating between shame and sympathy, her daughter
would take from the little she had and give it to her, tremulous
for fear the disturbing figure would prove her undoing.
Then the old woman would go out, lurching sometimes
in her cups, and disappear, while an observant fellow servant
was probably seeing and reporting to the mistress, who, of
course, did not want her to come there and so told the girl,
or, more practical still, discharged her.</p>

<p>Thus from her fourteenth to her sixteenth year she was
shunted from house to house and from shop to shop, always
in the vain hope that this time her mother might let her
alone.</p>

<p>And at the very same time, life, sweetened by the harmonies
of youth in the blood, was calling—that exterior life
which promised everything because so far it had given nothing.
The little simple things of existence, the very ordinary
necessities of clothing and ornament, with which the heart
of youth and the inherent pride of appearance are gratified,
had a value entirely disproportionate to their worth. Yes,
already she had turned the age wherein the chemic harmonies
in youth begin to sing, thought to thought, color to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
color, dream to dream. She was being touched by the
promise of life itself.</p>

<p>And then, as was natural, love in the guise of youth, a
rather sophisticated gallant somewhat above the world in
which she was moving, appeared and paid his all but worthless
court to her. He was physically charming, the son of
a grocer of some means in the vicinity in which she was
working, a handsome youth with pink cheeks and light
hair and blue eyes, and vanity enough for ten. Because
she was shy and pretty he became passingly interested in
her.</p>

<p>“Oh, I saw you cleaning the windows yesterday,” this
with a radiant, winning smile; or “You must live down
toward Blake Street. I see you going down that way once
in a while.”</p>

<p>Madeleine acknowledged rather shamefacedly that it was
true. That so dashing a boy should be interested in her was
too marvelous.</p>

<p>In the evenings, or at any time, it was easy for a youth
of his skill and <em>savoir-faire</em> to pick her out of the bobbing
stream of humanity in which she occasionally did errands or
visited her mother in her shabby room, and to suggest that
he be permitted to call upon her. Or, failing that, because
of her mother’s shabby quarters and her mother herself, that
the following Sunday would be ideal for an outing to one
of those tawdry, noisy beaches to which he liked to go with
other boys and girls in a car.</p>

<p>A single trip to Wonderland, a single visit to one of
its halls where music sounded to the splash of the waves and
where he did his best to teach her to dance, a single meal in
one of its gaudy, noisy restaurants, a taste of its whirly pleasures,
and a new color and fillip were given to hope, a new
and seemingly realizable dream of happiness implanted in her
young mind. The world was happier than she had thought,
or could be made so; not all people fought and screamed at
each other. There were such things as tenderness, soft words,
sweet words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>But the way of so sophisticated a youth with a maid
was brief and direct. His mind was of that order which
finds in the freshness of womankind a mere passing delight,
something to be deflowered and then put aside. He was a
part of a group that secured its happiness in rifling youth,
the youth of those whose lives were so dull and bleak that
a few words of kindness, a little change of scene, the mere
proximity of experience and force such as they had never
known, were pay ample for anything which they might
give or do.</p>

<p>And of these Madeleine was one.</p>

<p>Never having had anything in her own life, the mere
thought of a man so vigorous and handsome, one with
knowledge enough to show her more of life than she had
ever dreamed of, to take her to places of color and light,
to assure her that she was fitted for better things even
though they were not immediately forthcoming, was sufficient
to cause her to place faith where it was least worthy
of being placed. To win his way there was even talk of
marriage later on, that love should be generous and have
faith—and then—</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Plain-clothesman Amundsen, patrolling hawk-like the
region of Fourteenth and K streets, not so far from
Blake, where Madeleine had lived for a time, was becoming
interested in and slightly suspicious of a new
face.</p>

<p>For several days at odd hours, he had seen a girl half-slinking,
half-brazening her way through a region the very
atmosphere of which was blemishing to virtue. To be sure,
he had not yet seen her speak to any one; nor was there
that in her glance or manner which caused him to feel that
she might.</p>

<p>Still—with the assurance of his authority and his past
skill in trapping many he followed discreetly, seeing where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
she went, how she lingered for awhile nervously, then returned
as she had come. She was very young, not more than
seventeen.</p>

<p>He adjusted his tie and collar and decided to attempt his
skill.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Miss. Out for a little stroll? So am I.
Mind my walking along with you a little way? Wouldn’t
like to come and have a drink, would you? I work in an
automobile place over here in Grey Street, and I’m just off
for the afternoon. Live here in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p>Madeleine surveyed this stranger with troubled eyes.
Since the day her youthful lover had deserted her, and
after facing every conceivable type of ill, but never being
willing to confess or fall back upon her drunken, dreaming
mother for aid, she had tested every device. The necessities
and expenses incident to a prospective, and to her
degrading state, as well as the continued care of her mother,
had compelled her, as she had finally seen it, to come to this—for
a time anyhow. A street girl, finding her wandering
and crying, had taken her in hand and shown her, after
aiding her for weeks, how to make her way.</p>

<p>Her burden that she feared so much was artificially if
ruthlessly and criminally disposed of. Then she was shown
the way of the streets until she could gain a new foothold
in life; only, as she had since learned, it was difficult for
her to accommodate herself to this fell traffic. She was
not of it spiritually. She really did not intend to continue
in it; it was just a temporary makeshift, born of fear and
a dumb despair.</p>

<p>But neither Detective Amundsen nor the law was ready
to believe that. To the former she seemed as worthless as
any—one of those curious, uncared-for flowers never understood
by the dull.</p>

<p>In a nearby café she had listened to his inquiries, the fact
that he had a room in a nearby hotel, or could secure one.
Contemning a fate which drove her to such favors, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
fully resolved to leave it soon, to make something better of
her life in the future, she went with him.</p>

<p>Then came the scarring realization that he was an officer
of the law, a cynical, contemptuous hawk smirking over
her tears and her explanations. It was absolutely nothing
to him that she was so young and could scarcely have been
as hardened as he pretended. She was compelled to walk
through the streets with him to the nearest police station,
while he nodded to or stopped to explain to passing brothers
of the cloth the nature of his latest conquest.</p>

<p>There was the registering of her under the false name
that she chose, rather than be exposed under her true one,
before a brusque and staring sergeant in shirtsleeves; a cell
with a wooden bench, the first she had ever known; a
matron who searched her; then a ride somewhere in a
closed vehicle, and the usual swift and confusing arraignment
before a judge whose glance was seemingly so cold
that it was frightening.</p>

<p>“Nellie Fitzpatrick; Officer Amundsen, Eighth Precinct.”</p>

<p>The friend who had taught her the ways of the streets
had warned her that if caught and arrested it might mean
months of incarceration in some institution, the processes
or corrective meaning of which she did not quite comprehend.
All that she had grasped fully was that it meant a
severance from her freedom, the few little things, pitiful
as they were, that she could call her own. And now here
she was, in the clutches of the law, and with no one to
defend her.</p>

<p>The testimony of the officer was as it had been in hundreds
of cases before this; he had been walking his beat and
she had accosted him, as usual.</p>

<p>There being no legal alternative, the magistrate had held
her for sentence, pending investigation, and the investigation
proving, as it only could, that her life would be better
were some corrective measures applied to it, she was sent
away. She had never had any training worthy the name.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Her mother was an irresponsible inebriate. A few months
in some institution where she could be taught some trade
or craft would be best.</p>

<p>And so it was that for a period of a year she was turned
over to the care of the Sisterhood of the Good Shepherd.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The gray and bony walls of that institution starkly
dominated one of the barest and most unprepossessing regions
of the city. Its northern façade fronted a stone-yard,
beyond which were the rocks of the racing Sound and a
lighthouse. To the east, rocks and the river, a gray expanse
in winter picked over by gulls, mourned over by the horns
of endless craft. To the south, bare coal-yards, wagon-yards,
tenements.</p>

<p>Twice weekly, sentenced delinquents of various ages—the
“children,” of whom Madeleine was one; the “girls,”
ranging from eighteen to thirty; the “women,” ranging
from thirty to fifty; and the old people, ranging from fifty
until the last years of life—were brought here in an all
but air-tight cage, boxed like a great circus van, and with
only small barred air-holes at the top. Inside the van
were bare, hard benches, one against either wall. A representative
of the probation and control system of the city,
a gaunt female of many years, sat within; also an officer
of such prodigious proportions that the mere sight of him
might well raise the inquiry of why so much unnecessary
luggage. For amusement in dull hours he smoothed his
broad mouth with the back of his red, hairy hand, and
dreamed of bygone days.</p>

<p>The institution itself was operated by a Mother Superior
and thirty nuns, all of the order mentioned, all expert in
their separate ways in cooking, housekeeping, laundering,
buying, lace-making, teaching, and a half dozen other practical
or applied arts.</p>

<p>Within the institution were separate wings or sections for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
each of the four groups before mentioned, sections in which
each had its separate working, eating, sleeping and playing
rooms. Only one thing was shared in common: the
daily, and often twice or thrice daily, religious ceremonies
in the great chapel, a lofty, magi-decorated and be-altared
and be-candled chamber, whose tall, thin spire surmounted
with a cross might easily be seen from many of the chambers
in which the different groups worked. There were
masses in the mornings, vespers and late prayers in the
afternoons, often late prayers at night or on holidays, when
additional services of one kind and another were held. To
the religious-minded these were of course consoling. To the
contrary-minded they became at times a strain.</p>

<p>Always, and over all the work and all the routine relaxations
or pleasures of the institution, there hung the grim
insistence of the law, its executive arm, upon order, seemliness,
and, if not penance, at least a servility of mind which
was the equivalent thereof. Let the voices of the nuns be
never so soft, their footfalls light, their manners courteous,
their ways gentle, persuasive, sympathetic, their mood tender;
back of it all lay the shadow of the force which
could forthwith return any or all to the rough hands of
the police, the stern and not-to-be-evaded dictum of the
courts.</p>

<p>This, much more than any look of disappointment or
displeasure, if such were ever necessary, spoke to these delinquents
or victims, whatever their mood, and quieted them
in their most rebellious hours. Try as they would, they
could not but remember that it was the law that had placed
them here and now detained them. That there reigned here
peace, order, sweetness and harmony, was well enough,
comforting in cases, yet and always the life here had obviously
a two-fold base: one the power of the law itself,
the other the gentle, appealing, beautiful suasion of the
nuns.</p>

<p>But to so inexperienced and as yet unreasoning a child
as Madeleine all of this savored at this time of but one thing:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
the sharp, crude, inconsiderate and uninquiring forces of
law or life, which seemed never to stop and inquire how
or why, but only to order how, and that without mercy.
Like some frightened animal faced by a terrifying enemy,
she had thus far been able to think only of some darksome
corner into which she might slip and hide, a secret place
so inconspicuous and minute that the great savage world
without would not trouble or care to follow.</p>

<p>And well enough the majority of the Sisterhood, especially
those in immediate authority over her, understood
the probable direction and ramifications of her present
thoughts.</p>

<p>They knew her mood, for had they not during years
past dealt with many such? And stern as was the law, they
were not unmindful of her welfare. So long as she was
willing and obedient there was but one thing more: that
somehow her troubled or resentful or congealed and probably
cruelly injured mind should be wooed from its blind
belief in the essential injustice of life, to be made to feel,
as they themselves were ready to believe, that all paths
were not closed, all forces not essentially dark or evil.</p>

<p>For them there was hope of sorts for all, a way out, and
many—even she—might find ways and means of facing life,
better possibly than any she had ever known.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>Sister St. Agnes, for instance, who controlled the spotlessly
clean but barnlike and bleak room in which were
a hundred machines for the sewing of shirtwaists, was a
creature of none too fortunate a history herself.</p>

<p>Returning at the age of eighteen and at the death of her
father from a convent in which she had been placed by
him in order to escape the atmosphere of a home which
he himself had found unsatisfactory, she had found a fashionable
mother leading a life of which she could scarcely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
conceive, let alone accept. The taint, the subterfuge, the
self-indulgent waste, had as soon sickened her as had the
streets Madeleine.</p>

<p>Disappointed, she felt herself after a time incapable of
enduring it and had fled, seeking first to make her way in
a world which offered only meagre wages and a barren life
to those incapable of enduring its rugged and often shameless
devices; later, again wearied of her own trials, she had
returned to the convent in which she had been trained and
asked to be schooled for service there. Finding the life too
simple for a nature grown more rugged, she had asked to
be, and had been, transferred to the House of the Good
Shepherd, finding there for the first time, in this institution,
duties and opportunities which somehow matched her
ideals.</p>

<p>And by the same token the Mother Superior of this same
institution, Mother St. Bertha, who often came through
and inquired into the story of each one, was of a history
and of an order of mind which was not unlike that of
Sister St. Agnes, only it had even more of genuine pathos
and suffering in it. The daughter of a shoe manufacturer,
she had seen her father fail, her mother die of consumption,
a favorite brother drink and carouse until he finally
fell under the blight of disease and died. The subsequent
death of her father, to whom she had devoted her years,
and the failing of her own dreams of a personal love, had
saddened her, and she sought out and was admitted to
this order in the hope that she, too, might still make
especial use of a life that promised all too little in the world
outside.</p>

<p>Her great comfort was in having some one or something
to love, the satisfaction of feeling that lives which otherwise
might have come to nothing had by some service of
hers been lifted to a better state. And in that thought she
worked here daily, going about among those incarcerated
in different quarters, seeing to it that their tasks were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
not too severe, their comforts and hopes, where hope still
remained, in nowise betrayed.</p>

<p>But to Madeleine at first the solemn habits of the nuns,
as well as the gray gingham apron she had to don, the
grayer woolen dress, the severe manner in which she had
to dress her hair, her very plain shoes, the fact that she had
to rise at six-thirty, attend mass and then breakfast at eight,
work from eight-thirty to twelve-thirty, and again from
one-thirty to four; lunch regularly at twelve-thirty and sup
at six, attend a form of prayer service at four-thirty, play
at simple games with her new companions between five and
six and again between seven and nine, and then promptly
retire to a huge sleeping-ward set with small white iron
beds in long rows, and lit, after the retiring bell had
sounded, by small oil cups or candles burning faintly before
various images, all smacked of penance, the more disturbing
because it was strange, a form of personal control which
she had not sought and could not at once accept.</p>

<p>Nor could she help thinking that some severer form of
punishment was yet to be meted out to her, or might ensue
by reason of one unavoidable error or another. Life had
always been so with her. But, once here a time, things
proved not so bad.</p>

<p>The large workroom with its hundred machines and its
tall windows, which afforded a stark view of the coal-pockets
to the south, and the river with its boats and gulls,
proved not unpleasing. The clean, bright windows, polished
floors and walls—washed and cleaned by the inmates themselves,
the nuns not disdaining to do their share—and the
habits of the Sisters, their white-fringed hoods, black robes
and clinking beads and their silent tread and low speech,
impressed her greatly.</p>

<p>The fact that there was no severe reproof for any failure
to comprehend at first, but only slow and patient explanations
of simple things, not difficult in themselves to do;
that aside from the routine duties, the marching in line
with hands crossed over breast and head up, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
genuflections at mass, prayers before and after meals, at
rising and on retiring and at the peal of the Angelus,
morning, noon and night, there was no real oppression,
finally caused her to like it.</p>

<p>The girls who were here with her, shy or silent or cold
or indifferent at first, and each with her world of past
experiences, contacts and relationships locked in her heart,
were still, placed as they were elbow to elbow at work, at
meals, at prayer, at retiring, incapable of not achieving some
kind of remote fellowship which eventually led to speech
and confidences.</p>

<p>Thus the young girl who sat next at her right in the
sewing-room—Viola Patters by name, a brave, blonde,
cheerful little thing—although she had endured much that
might be called ill-fortune, was still intensely interested
in life.</p>

<p>By degrees and as they worked the two reached an understanding.
Viola confessed that her father, who was a non-union
painter by trade, had always worked well enough
when he could get work, but that he managed badly and
could not always get it. Her mother was sickly and they
were very poor and there were many children.</p>

<p>Viola had first worked in a box-factory, where she had
been able to earn only three dollars or less at piece work—“pasting
corners,” as she described it—and once she had
been sworn at and even thrown away from a table at which
she had been working because she didn’t do it right, and
then she quit. Then her father in turn swearing at her for
her “uppishness,” she had got work in a five-and-ten-cent
store, where she had received three dollars a week and a
commission of one per cent on her sales, which were not
sufficient to yield more than a dollar more. Then she had
secured a better place in a department store at five dollars
a week, and there it was that she had come by the handsome
boy who had caused her so much trouble.</p>

<p>He was a taxi-driver, who always had a car at his disposal
when he worked, only it was very seldom that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
cared to work. Although he married her swiftly enough
and took her away from her family, still he had not supported
her very well, and shortly after they were married
he was arrested and accused with two others of stealing a
machine and selling it, and after months and months of jail
life he had been sentenced to three years in the penitentiary.</p>

<p>In the meantime he had called upon her to aid him,
pressed her to raise sums of which she had never previously
dreamed—and by ways of which she had never previously
dreamed—was pleaded with, all but ordered—and still she
loved him. And then in executing the “how” of it she
had been picked up by the police and sent here, as had
Madeleine, only she never told, not even to Madeleine, what
the police had never discovered—that at the suggestion of
her first love she had included robbery among her arts.</p>

<p>“But I don’t care,” she had whispered finally as they
worked. “He was good to me, anyhow, when he had work.
He was crazy about me, and he liked to go places and
dance and eat and see shows when he had money, and he
always took me. Gee, the times we’ve had! And if he
wants me to stick to him when he gets out, I will. He
ain’t half as bad as some. Gee, you oughta hear some of
the girls talk!”</p>

<p>And so it was finally that Madeleine was induced to tell
her story.</p>

<p>There were other girls here who, once this bond of
sympathy was struck, were keen enough to tell their tales—sad,
unfortunate, harried lives all—and somehow the mere
telling of them restored to Madeleine some of her earlier
faint confidence or interest in life. It was “bad,” but it
was vivid. For in spite of their unfortunate beginnings,
the slime in which primarily and without any willing of
their own they had been embedded and from which nearly
all were seeking to crawl upwards, and bravely enough,
they had heart for and faith in life.</p>

<p>In all cases, apparently, love was their star as well as
their bane. They thought chiefly of the joy that might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
had in joining their lives with some man or being out in
the free world, working again possibly, at least in touch
in some feeble way with the beauty and gayety of life, as
beauty and gayety manifested themselves to them.</p>

<p>And so by degrees, the crash of her own original hopes
echoing less and less loudly in the distance, the pain of
her great shame and rude awakening passed farther and
farther from her. The smoothness and regularity of this
austere life, indifferent as it seemed at times, consoled her
by its very security and remoteness from the world. It
was lean and spare, to be sure, but it offered safety and
rest to the mind and heart. Now, rising in her dim, silent
ward of a morning, repeating her instructed prayers, marching
in silence to chapel, to breakfast, to work, hearing only
the soft hum of the machines, marching again to chapel,
playing each day, but not too noisily, and finally retiring
in the same ordered and silent way to her tiny bed, she was
soothed and healed.</p>

<p>And yet, or perhaps because of this, she could not help
thinking of the clangor and crash of the world without. It
had been grim and painful to her, but in its rude, brutal way
it had been alive. The lighted streets at night! The cars!
That dancing pavilion in which once she had been taught
to dance by the great blue sea! The vanished touches of
her faithless lover’s hands—his kisses—brief, so soon over!
Where was he now in the great strange world outside?
With whom? What was she like? And would he tire of
her as quickly? Treat her as badly? Where was Tina?
Frank? Her mother? What had happened to her mother?
Not a word had she heard.</p>

<p>To Sister St. Agnes, after a time, sensing her to be generous,
faithful, patient, she had confided all concerning
herself and her mother, crying on her shoulder, and the
Sister had promised to learn what she could. But the investigation
proving that her mother had been sent to the workhouse,
she deemed it best to say nothing for the present.
Madeleine would find her quickly enough on returning to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
the world. Why cloud the new budding life with so shameful
a memory?</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>And then once more, in due time, and with the memory
of these things clinging fast to her, she was sent forth into
the world, not quite as poorly-armed as before, perhaps, but
still with the limited equipment which her own innate disposition
and comprehension compelled.</p>

<p>After many serious and presumably wise injunctions as
to the snares and pitfalls of this world, and accompanied
by a black-habited nun, who took her direct to one of those
moral and religious families whose strict adherence to the
tenets of this particular faith was held to provide an ideal
example, she was left to her own devices and the type of
work she had previously followed, the nuns themselves being
hard put to it to discover anything above the most menial
forms of employment for their various charges. Theirs
was a type of schooling and training which did not rise
above a theory of morality requiring not so much skill as
faith and blind obedience.</p>

<p>And again, here, as in the institution itself, the idea of
a faith, a religion, a benign power above that of man and
seeking his welfare, surrounded her as the very air itself
or as an aura, although she personally was by no means
ready to accept it, never having given it serious thought.</p>

<p>Everywhere here, as in the institution itself, were little
images or colored pictures of saints, their brows circled by
stars or crowns, their hands holding sceptres or lilies, their
bodies arrayed in graceful and soothing robes of white, blue,
pink and gold. Their faces were serene, their eyes benignly
contemplative, yet to Madeleine they were still images only,
pretty and graceful, even comforting, but at so great variance
to life as she knew it as to be little more than pretty
pictures.</p>

<p>In the great church which they attended, and to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
they persuaded her to accompany them, were more of these
same candle-lit pictures of saints, images and altars starred
with candles, many or few, at which she was wont to stare
in wonder and awe. The vestments of the priest and the
acolytes, the white-and-gold and red-and-gold of the chasuble
and the stole and the cope, the gold and silver crosses,
chalices and winecups, overawed her inexperienced and
somewhat impressionable mind without convincing it of the
immanence of superior forces whose significance or import
she could in nowise guess. God, God, God—she heard of
Him and the passion and death of the self-sacrificing Lord
Jesus.</p>

<p>And here, as there, the silence, the order, the cleanliness
and regularity, as well as simplicity, were the things which
most invested her reason and offered the greatest contrasts
to her old life.</p>

<p>She had not known or sensed the significance of these
things before. Now, day by day, like the dripping of water,
the ticking of time, they made an impression, however slight.
Routine, routine, routine, and the habit and order and color
of a vast and autocratic religion, made their lasting impression
upon her.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of an occasional supervisory visit on the
part of one or other of the nuns of the probation department,
she was not only permitted but compelled to work
out her life as best she might, and upon such wages as
she could command or devise. For all the prayers and the
good-will of the nuns, life was as insistent and driving as
ever. It did not appear to be so involved with religion.
In spite of the admonitions of the church, the family for
whom she was working saw little more in its religious obligation
than that she should be housed and fed according
to her material merits. If she wished to better herself, as
she soon very clearly saw she must, she would have to develop
a skill which she did not now have and which, once
developed, would make her of small use here. At the same
time, if the months spent in the institution had conveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
to her the reasonableness of making something better of
her life than hitherto she had been able to do, the world,
pleasure, hope, clanged as insistently and as wooingly as
ever before.</p>

<p>But how? How? was the great problem. Hers was
no resourceful, valiant soul, capable of making its own
interesting way alone. Think as she would, and try, love,
and love only, the admiration and ministering care of some
capable and affectionate man was the only thing that seemed
likely to solve for her the various earthly difficulties which
beset her.</p>

<p>But even as to this, how, in what saving or perfect way,
was love to come to her? She had made one mistake which
in the development of any honest relationship with another
would have to be confessed. And how would it be then?
Would love, admiration, forgive? Love, love, love, and the
peace and comfort of that happy routine home life which
she imagined she saw operative in the lives of others—how
it glimmered afar, like a star!</p>

<p>And again there was her mother.</p>

<p>It was not long after she had come from the institution
that sheer loneliness, as well as a sense of daughterly responsibility
and pity, had urged her to look up her mother,
in order that she might restore to herself some little trace
of a home, however wretched it might be. She had no one,
as she proceeded to argue. At least in her own lonely life
her mother provided, or would, an ear and a voice, sympathetic
if begging, a place to go.</p>

<p>She had learned on returning to their last living-place
on one of her afternoons off, that her mother had been sent
away to the “Island,” but had come back and since had been
sent to the city poor-farm. This last inquiry led eventually
to her mother’s discovery of her and of her fixing herself
upon her once more as a dependent, until her death somewhat
over a year later.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, and after all, life continued to call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
and call and to drive her on, for she was still full of the
hope and fever of youth.</p>

<p>Once, before leaving the institution in which they had
worked together, Viola Patters had said to her in one of
those bursts of confidence based on attraction:</p>

<p>“Once you’re outa here an’ I am, too, I’d like to see you
again, only there ain’t no use your writin’ me here, for I
don’t believe they’d give it to me. I don’t believe they’d
want us to run together. I don’t believe they like me as
well as they do you. But you write me, wherever you are,
care of —,” and here she gave a definite address—“an’ I’ll
get it when I get out.”</p>

<p>She assured Madeleine that she would probably be able
to get a good place, once she was free of the control of the
Sisters, and then she might be able to do something for her.</p>

<p>Often during these dark new days she thought of this,
and being hard-pressed for diverting interests in her life
she finally wrote her, receiving in due time a request to
come and see her.</p>

<p>But, as it proved, Viola was no avenue of improvement
for her in her new mood. She was, as Madeleine soon
discovered, part of a small group which was making its way
along a path which she had promised herself henceforth to
avoid. Viola was more comfortably placed in quarters of
her own than Madeleine had ever been, but the method
by which she was forwarding her life she could not as
readily accept.</p>

<p>Yet her own life, move about as she might and did after
a time from one small position to another, in store or factory,
in the hope of bettering herself, held nothing either.
Day by day as she worked she sensed all the more clearly
that the meagre tasks at which she toiled could bring her
nothing of permanent value. Her mother was dead now,
and she more alone than ever. During a period of several
years, in which she worked and dreamed, leading a thin,
underpaid life, her mind was ever on love and what it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
might do for her—the pressure of a seeking hand, the sanctuary
of an enveloping heart.</p>

<p>And then, for the second time in her brief life, love
came, or seemed to—at least in her own heart if nowhere
else.</p>

<p>She had by now, and through her own efforts, attained to
a clerkship in one of the great stores at the salary of seven
dollars a week, on which she was trying to live. And then,
behold, one day among her customers one of those suave
and artful masters of the art of living by one’s wits, with
a fortune of looks, to whom womanhood is a thing to be
taken by an upward curl of a pair of mustachios, the vain
placement of ringed locks, spotless and conspicuous linen,
and clothes and shoes of a newness and lustre all but disturbing
to a very work-a-day world. His manners and
glances were of a winsomeness which only the feminine
heart—and that unschooled in the valuelessness of veneer—fully
appreciates.</p>

<p>Yes, the sheer grace of the seeking male, his shallow and
heartless courtesy, the lustre of his eye and skin, a certain
something of shabby-grand manner, such as she had never
known in the particularly narrow world in which she
moved, was sufficient to arrest and fix her interest.</p>

<p>He leaned over and examined the stationery and pencils
which she sold, commenting on prices, the routine of her
work, smiled archly and suggested by his manner entire
that she was one in whom he could be deeply interested. At
the same time a certain animal magnetism, of the workings
of which she was no more conscious than might be any
stick or stone, took her in its tow.</p>

<p>Here was one out of many, a handsome beau, who was
interested in her and her little life. The oiled and curled
hair became the crown of a god; the mustachios and the
sharp, cruel nose harmonies of exquisite beauty. Even the
muscular, prehensile hands were rhythmic, musical in their
movements. She had time only to sense the wonder of his
perfect self before he went away. But it was to return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
another day, with an even more familiar and insinuating
grace.</p>

<p>He was interested in her, as he frankly said the next
time, and she must be his friend. At lunch-time one day
he was waiting to take her to a better restaurant than she
would ever have dreamed of entering; on another day it
was to dinner that she accompanied him.</p>

<p>According to him, she was beautiful, wonderful. Her
flower-like life was being wasted on so rude a task. She
should marry him, and then her difficulties would be solved.
He was one who, when fortune was with him, so he said,
made much, much money. He might even take her from
the city at times to see strange places and interesting scenes.</p>

<p>As for her own stunted life, from most of the details of
which she forbore, he seemed in nowise interested. It was
not due to any lack on her part in the past that her life had
been so ill....</p>

<p>Love, love, love.... The old story. In a final burst of
admiration and love for his generosity she told him of her
one great error, which caused him a few moments of solemn
cogitation and was then dismissed as nothing of importance,
a pathetic, childish mistake. Then there followed one of
those swift and seemingly unguarded unions, a commonplace
of the tangled self-preserving underworld of poverty.
A clergyman was found whose moral assurances seemed to
make the union ideal. Then a room in a commonplace
boarding-house, and the newer and better life which eventually
was to realize all was begun.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>To those familiar with the brazen and relentless methods
of a certain type of hawk of the underworld, which picks
fledglings from the nest and springlings from the fields
and finds life itself only a hunting-ground in which those
mentally or physically weaker than itself may be enslaved,
this description will seem neither strained nor inadequate.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
Fagins of sex, creatures who change their women as they
would their coats, they make an easy if reprehensible bed
of their lives, and such of their victims as have known
them well testify that for a while at least in their care or
custody they were not unhappy.</p>

<p>So it was with Madeleine and her lover. With amused
and laughing tolerance toward her natural if witless efforts
to build up a home atmosphere about their presumably joint
lives, to build for a future in which they should jointly
share, he saw in them only something trivial or ridiculous,
whereas to her it was as though the heavens had opened
and she was surveying a new world. For in his love and
care there was to be peace. Latterly, if not now—for
already he complained of conditions which made it impossible
for him to work—the results of their several labors
were to be pooled in order to prepare for that something
better which would soon be achieved—a home, an ideally
happy state somewhere. Even children were in her mind.</p>

<p>The mere fact that he shortly complained of other temporary
reverses which made it necessary for him and her
to keep close watch over their resources, and that for the
time being, until he “could arrange his affairs,” she must
find some employment which would pay much better than
her old one, gave her no shock.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was an indescribable joy for her to do for her
love, for love had come, that great solvent of all other
earthly difficulties, that leveler of all but insurmountable
barriers. Even now love was to make her life flower at
last. There was an end to loneliness and the oppressive
indifference of the great sea of life.</p>

<p>But, as in the first instance, so now the awakening was
swift and disconcerting. Realizing the abject adoration
in which she held his surface charms and that his thin,
tricky soul was the beginning and the end of things for
her, it was all the easier to assure her, and soon insist, that
the easiest and swiftest way of making money, of which she
was unfortunately aware, must be resorted to, for a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
necessity had come upon him. The usual tale of a threatening
disaster, a sudden loss at cards which might end in
imprisonment for him and their enforced separation, was
enough.</p>

<p>Swiftly he filled her ears with tales of rescues by women
of many of his men friends similarly circumstanced, of the
“fools” and “marks” that filled the thoroughfares to be
captured and preyed upon by women. Why hesitate?
Consider the meagre, beggarly wages she had previously
earned, the nothingness of her life before. Why jeopardize
their future now? Why be foolish, dull? Plainly it was
nothing to love, as he saw it. Should it be so much to her?
In this wise she was persuaded.</p>

<p>But now it was not the shame and the fear of arrest
that troubled her, but the injury which love had done and
was doing to her, that cut and burned and seared and
scarred.</p>

<p>Love, as she now began dimly to realize once more,
should not be so. More than anything else, if love was
what she had always dreamed, should it not protect and
save and keep her for itself? And now see. Love was
sending her out again to loiter in doorways and before
windows and to “make eyes.”</p>

<p>It was this that turned like a wheel in her brain and
heart. For in spite of the roughness of her emotional experiences
thus far, she had faith to believe that love should
not be so, should not do so.</p>

<p>Those features which to this hour, and long after, like
those features of her first love, seemed so worship-worth,
those eyes that had seemed to beam on her with love,
the lips that had smiled so graciously and kissed hers, the
hands and arms that had petted and held her, should not be
part of the compulsion that sent her here.</p>

<p>No, love should be better than that. He himself had told
her so at first—that she was worth more than all else to
him—and now see!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>And then one night, fully a year and a half later, the
climax. Being particularly irritated by some money losses
and the need of enduring her at all, even though she might
still prove of some value as a slave, he turned on her with
a savage fury.</p>

<p>“What, only...! Get to hell outa here! What do
you think I am—a sucker? And let go my arm. Don’t
come that stuff on me. I’m sick of it. Don’t hang on my
arm, I tell yah! I’m tired, damned tired! Get out! Go
on—beat it, an’ don’t come back, see? I’m through—through—yuh
hear me? I mean what I say. I’m through,
once an’ fer all. Beat it, an’ fer good. Don’t come back.
I’ve said that before, but this time it <em>goes</em>! Go on, now
quick— Scat!—an’ don’t ever let me see yah around
here any more, yah hear?—yah damned piece o’ mush,
yah!”</p>

<p>He pushed her away, throwing open the door as he did
so, and, finding her still pleading and clinging, threw her
out with such force that she cut her left eye and the back
of her left hand against the jamb of the door.</p>

<p>There was a cry of “Fred! Fred! Please! Please!”—and
then the door was slammed and she was left leaning
disconsolately and brokenly against the stair-rail outside.</p>

<p>And now, as before, the cruelty and inscrutability of life
weighed on her, only now, less than before, had she hope
wherewith to buoy herself. It was all so dark, so hopeless.
Often in this hour she thought of the swift, icy waters
of the river, glistening under a winter moon, and then again
of the peace and quiet of the House of the Good Shepherd,
its shielding remoteness from life, the only true home or
sanctuary she had ever known. And so, brooding and repressing
occasional sobs, she made her way toward it, down
the long streets, thinking of the pathetically debasing love-life
that was now over—the dream of love that never, never
could be again, for her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>The stark red walls of the institution stood as before,
only dim and gray and cold under a frosty winter moon.
It was three of a chill, cold morning. She had come a long
way, drooping, brooding, half-freezing and crying. More
than once on the way the hopelessness of her life and her
dreams had given her pause, causing her to turn again with
renewed determination toward the river—only the vivid and
reassuring picture she had retained of this same grim and
homely place, its restricted peace and quiet, the sympathy
of Sister St. Agnes and Mother St. Bertha, had carried
her on.</p>

<p>En route she speculated as to whether they would receive
her now, so objectionable and grim was her tale. And yet
she could not resist continuing toward it, so reassuring was
its memory, only to find it silent, not a single light burning.
But, after all, there was one, at a side door—not the
great cold gate by which she had first been admitted but
another to one side, to her an all but unknown entrance;
and to it after some brooding hesitation she made her way,
ringing a bell and being admitted by a drowsy nun, who
ushered her into the warmth and quiet of the inner hallway.
Once in she mechanically followed to the bronze grille
which, as prison bars, obstructed the way, and here on
one of the two plain chairs placed before a small aperture
she now sank wearily and looked through.</p>

<p>Her cut eye was hurting her and her bruised hands. On
the somewhat faded jacket and crumpled hat, pulled on indifferently
because she was too hurt to think or care, there
was some blown snow. And when the Sister Secretary
in charge of the room after midnight, hearing footsteps,
came to the grille, she looked up wanly, her little red, rough
hands crossed on her lap.</p>

<p>“Mother,” she said beseechingly, “may I come in?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Then remembering that only Mother St. Bertha could
admit her, added wearily:</p>

<p>“Is Mother St. Bertha here? I was here before. She
will know me.”</p>

<p>The Sister Secretary surveyed her curiously, sensing more
of the endless misery that was ever here, but seeing that she
was sick or in despair hastened to call her superior, whose
rule it was that all such requests for admission should be
referred to her. There was no stir in the room in her
absence. Presently pattened feet were heard, and the face
of Mother St. Bertha, wrinkled and a-weary, appeared at
the square opening.</p>

<p>“What is it, my child?” she asked curiously if softly,
wondering at the crumpled presence at this hour.</p>

<p>“Mother,” began Madeleine tremulously, looking up and
recognizing her, “don’t you remember me? It is Madeleine.
I was here four years ago. I was in the girls’ ward. I
worked in the sewing-room.”</p>

<p>She was so beaten by life, the perpetual endings to her
never more than tremulous hopes, that even now and here
she expected little more than an indifference which would
send her away again.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, of course I remember you, my child. But
what is it that brings you now, dear? Your eye is cut, and
your hand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, but please don’t ask—just now. Oh,
please let me come in! I am so tired! I’ve had such a
hard time!”</p>

<p>“Of course, my child,” said the Mother, moving to the
door and opening it. “You may come in. But what has
happened, child? How is it that your cheek is cut, and your
hands?”</p>

<p>“Mother,” pleaded Madeleine wearily, “must I answer
now? I am so unhappy! Can’t I just have my old dress
and my bed for to-night—that little bed under the lamp?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, dear, you may have them, of course,” said
the nun, tactfully sensing a great grief. “And you need<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
not talk now. I think I know how it is. Come with me.”</p>

<p>She led the way along bare, dimly lit corridors and up
cold solid iron stairs, echoing to the feet, until once more,
as in the old days, the severe but spotless room in which
were the baths and the hampers for soiled clothes was
reached.</p>

<p>“Now, my child,” she said, “you may undress and bathe.
I will get something for your eye.”</p>

<p>And so here at last, once more, Madeleine put aside the
pathetic if showy finery that for a time had adorned and
shamed her: a twilled skirt she had only recently bought in
the pale hope of interesting <em>him</em>, the commonplace little hat
for which she had paid ten dollars, the striped shirtwaist,
once a pleasure to her in the hope that it would please <em>him</em>.</p>

<p>In a kind of dumbness of despair she took off her shoes
and stockings and, as the Mother left, entered the warm,
clean bath which had been provided. She stifled a sob as
she did so, and others as she bathed. Then she stepped
out and dried her body and covered it with the clean, simple
slip of white which had been laid on a chair, brushing her
hair and touching her eye, until the Mother Sister returned
with an unguent wherewith to dress it.</p>

<p>Then she was led along other silent passages, once dreary
enough but now healing in their sense of peace and rest,
and so into the great room set with row upon row of simple
white iron beds, covered with their snowy linen and illuminated
only by the minute red lamps or the small candles
burning before their idealistic images here and there, beneath
which so many like herself were sleeping. Over the
bed which she had once occupied, and which by chance was
then vacant, burned the one little lamp which she recognized
as of old—her lamp, as she had always thought of it—a
thin and flickering flame, before an image of the Virgin.
At sight of it she repressed a sob.</p>

<p>“You see, my child,” said the Mother Superior poetically,
“it must have been waiting for you. Anyhow it is empty.
Perhaps it may have known you were coming.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>She spoke softly so that the long rows of sleepers might
not be disturbed, then proceeded to turn down the coverlets.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother,” Madeleine suddenly whispered softly as
she stood by the bed, “won’t you let me stay always? I
never want to go out any more. I have had such a hard
time. I will work so hard for you if you will let me stay!”</p>

<p>The experienced Sister looked at her curiously. Never
before had she heard such a plea.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, my child,” she said. “If you wish to stay
I’m sure it can be arranged. It is not as we usually do,
but you are not the only one who has gone out in the past
and come back to us. I am sure God and the Blessed Virgin
will hear your prayer for whatever is right. But now go
to bed and sleep. You need rest. I can see that. And to-morrow,
or any time, or never, as you choose, you may tell
me what has happened.”</p>

<p>She urged her very gently to enter and then tucked the
covers about her, laying finally a cool, wrinkled hand on
her forehead. For answer Madeleine seized and put it to
her lips, holding it so.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother,” she sobbed as the Sister bent over her,
“don’t ever make me go out in the world again, will you?
You won’t, will you? I’m so tired! I’m so tired!”</p>

<p>“No dear, no,” soothed the Sister, “not unless you wish
it. And now rest. You need never go out in the world
again unless you wish.”</p>

<p>And withdrawing the hand from the kissing lips, she
tiptoed silently from the room.</p>

THE HAND</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Davidson</span> could distinctly remember that it was
between two and three years after the grisly event
in the Monte Orte range—the sickening and yet deserved
end of Mersereau, his quondam partner and fellow adventurer—that
anything to be identified with Mersereau’s
malice toward him, and with Mersereau’s probable present
existence in the spirit world, had appeared in his life.</p>

<p>He and Mersereau had worked long together as prospectors,
investors, developers of property. It was only
after they had struck it rich in the Klondike that Davidson
had grown so much more apt and shrewd in all commercial
and financial matters, whereas Mersereau had seemed to
stand still—not to rise to the splendid opportunities which
then opened to him. Why, in some of those later deals it
had not been possible for Davidson even to introduce his
old partner to some of the moneyed men he had to deal
with. Yet Mersereau had insisted, as his right, if you
please, on being “in on” everything—everything!</p>

<p>Take that wonderful Monte Orte property, the cause of
all the subsequent horror. He, Davidson—not Mersereau—had
discovered or heard of the mine, and had carried it
along, with old Besmer as a tool or decoy—Besmer being
the ostensible factor—until it was all ready for him to take
over and sell or develop. Then it was that Mersereau,
having been for so long his partner, demanded a full half—a
third, at least—on the ground that they had once agreed
to work together in all these things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>Think of it! And Mersereau growing duller and less
useful and more disagreeable day by day, and year by year!
Indeed, toward the last he had threatened to expose the
trick by which jointly, seven years before, they had possessed
themselves of the Skyute Pass Mine; to drive Davidson
out of public and financial life, to have him arrested and
tried—along with himself, of course. Think of that!</p>

<p>But he had fixed him—yes, he had, damn him! He had
trailed Mersereau that night to old Besmer’s cabin on the
Monte Orte, when Besmer was away. Mersereau had gone
there with the intention of stealing the diagram of the new
field, and had secured it, true enough. A thief he was,
damn him. Yet, just as he was making safely away, as he
thought, he, Davidson, had struck him cleanly over the ear
with that heavy rail-bolt fastened to the end of a walnut
stick, and the first blow had done for him.</p>

<p>Lord, how the bone above Mersereau’s ear had sounded
when it cracked! And how bloody one side of that bolt
was! Mersereau hadn’t had time to do anything before he
was helpless. He hadn’t died instantly, though, but had
turned over and faced him, Davidson, with that savage,
scowling face of his and those blazing, animal eyes.</p>

<p>Lying half propped up on his left elbow, Mersereau had
reached out toward him with that big, rough, bony right
hand of his—the right with which he always boasted of
having done so much damage on this, that, and the other
occasion—had glared at him as much as to say:</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only reach you just for a moment before
I go!”</p>

<p>Then it was that he, Davidson, had lifted the club again.
Horrified as he was, and yet determined that he must save
his own life, he had finished the task, dragging the body
back to an old fissure behind the cabin and covering it with
branches, a great pile of pine fronds, and as many as one
hundred and fifty boulders, great and small, and had left
his victim. It was a sickening job and a sickening sight,
but it had to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Then, having finished, he had slipped dismally away, like
a jackal, thinking of that hand in the moonlight, held up
so savagely, and that look. Nothing might have come of
that either, if he hadn’t been inclined to brood on it so
much, on the fierceness of it.</p>

<p>No, nothing had happened. A year had passed, and if
anything had been going to turn up it surely would have by
then. He, Davidson, had gone first to New York, later to
Chicago, to dispose of the Monte Orte claim. Then, after
two years, he had returned here to Mississippi, where he
was enjoying comparative peace. He was looking after
some sugar property which had once belonged to him, and
which he was now able to reclaim and put in charge of his
sister as a home against a rainy day. He had no other.</p>

<p>But that body back there! That hand uplifted in the
moonlight—to clutch him if it could! Those eyes.</p>


<h3>II—<span class="smcap">June, 1905</span></h3>

<p>Take that first year, for instance, when he had returned
to Gatchard in Mississippi, whence both he and Mersereau
had originally issued. After looking after his own property
he had gone out to a tumble-down estate of his uncle’s
in Issaqueena County—a leaky old slope-roofed house where,
in a bedroom on the top floor, he had had his first experience
with the significance or reality of the hand.</p>

<p>Yes, that was where first he had really seen it pictured
in that curious, unbelievable way; only who would believe
that it was Mersereau’s hand? They would say it was an
accident, chance, rain dropping down. But the hand had
appeared on the ceiling of that room just as sure as anything,
after a heavy rain-storm—it was almost a cyclone—when
every chink in the old roof had seemed to leak water.</p>

<p>During the night, after he had climbed to the room by
way of those dismal stairs with their great landing and
small glass oil-lamp he carried, and had sunk to rest, or tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
to, in the heavy, wide, damp bed, thinking, as he always did
those days, of the Monte Orte and Mersereau, the storm
had come up. As he had listened to the wind moaning
outside he had heard first the scratch, scratch, scratch, of
some limb, no doubt, against the wall—sounding, or so it
seemed in his feverish unrest, like some one penning an
indictment against him with a worn, rusty pen.</p>

<p>And then, the storm growing worse, and in a fit of irritation
and self-contempt at his own nervousness, he had
gone to the window, but just as lightning struck a branch
of the tree nearest the window and so very near him, too—as
though some one, something, was seeking to strike him—(Mersereau?)
and as though he had been lured by that
scratching. God! He had retreated, feeling that it was
meant for him.</p>

<p>But that big, knotted hand painted on the ceiling by
the dripping water during the night! There it was, right
over him when he awoke, outlined or painted as if with
wet, gray whitewash against the wretched but normally
pale-blue of the ceiling when dry. There it was—a big,
open hand just like Mersereau’s as he had held it up that
night—huge, knotted, rough, the fingers extended as if
tense and clutching. And, if you will believe it, near it was
something that looked like a pen—an old, long-handled
pen—to match that scratch, scratch, scratch!</p>

<p>“Huldah,” he had inquired of the old black mammy who
entered in the morning to bring him fresh water and throw
open the shutters, “what does that look like to you up there—that
patch on the ceiling where the rain came through?”</p>

<p>He wanted to reassure himself as to the character of the
thing he saw—that it might not be a creation of his own
feverish imagination, accentuated by the dismal character
of this place.</p>

<p>“’Pears t’ me mo’ like a big han’ ’an anythin’ else, Marse
Davi’son,” commented Huldah, pausing and staring upward.
“Mo’ like a big fist, kinda. Dat air’s a new drip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
come las’ night, I reckon. Dis here ole place ain’ gonna
hang togethah much longah, less’n some repairin’ be done
mighty quick now. Yassir, dat air’s a new drop, sho’s yo’
bo’n, en it come on’y las’ night. I hain’t never seed dat
befo’.”</p>

<p>And then he had inquired, thinking of the fierceness of
the storm:</p>

<p>“Huldah, do you have many such storms up this way?”</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Marse Davi’son, we hain’t seed no sech
blow en—en come three years now. I hain’t seed no sech
lightnin’ en I doan’ know when.”</p>

<p>Wasn’t that strange, that it should all come on the night,
of all nights, when he was there? And no such other storm
in three years!</p>

<p>Huldah stared idly, always ready to go slow and rest, if
possible, whereas he had turned irritably. To be annoyed
by ideas such as this! To always be thinking of that Monte
Orte affair! Why couldn’t he forget it? Wasn’t it Mersereau’s
own fault? He never would have killed the man if
he hadn’t been forced to it.</p>

<p>And to be haunted in this way, making mountains out of
mole-hills, as he thought then! It must be his own miserable
fancy—and yet Mersereau had looked so threateningly at
him. That glance had boded something; it was too terrible
not to.</p>

<p>Davidson might not want to think of it, but how could he
stop? Mersereau might not be able to hurt him any more, at
least not on this earth; but still, couldn’t he? Didn’t the appearance
of this hand seem to indicate that he might? He
was dead, of course. His body, his skeleton, was under that
pile of rocks and stones, some of them as big as wash-tubs.
Why worry over that, and after two years? And still—</p>

<p>That hand on the ceiling!</p>


<h3>III—<span class="smcap">December, 1905</span></h3>

<p>Then, again, take that matter of meeting Pringle in
Gatchard just at that time, within the same week. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
due to Davidson’s sister. She had invited Mr. and Mrs.
Pringle in to meet him one evening, without telling him
that they were spiritualists and might discuss spiritualism.</p>

<p>Clairvoyance, Pringle called it, or seeing what can’t be
seen with material eyes, and clairaudience, or hearing what
can’t be heard with material ears, as well as materialization,
or ghosts, and table-rapping, and the like. Table-rapping—that
damned tap-tapping that he had been hearing ever
since!</p>

<p>It was Pringle’s fault, really. Pringle had persisted in
talking. He, Davidson, wouldn’t have listened, except that
he somehow became fascinated by what Pringle said concerning
what he had heard and seen in his time. Mersereau
must have been at the bottom of that, too.</p>

<p>At any rate, after he had listened, he was sorry, for
Pringle had had time to fill his mind full of those awful
facts or ideas which had since harassed him so much—all
that stuff about drunkards, degenerates, and weak people
generally being followed about by vile, evil spirits and used
to effect those spirits’ purposes or desires in this world.
Horrible!</p>

<p>Wasn’t it terrible? Pringle—big, mushy, creature that he
was, sickly and stagnant like a springless pool—insisted that
he had even seen clouds of these spirits about drunkards,
degenerates, and the like, in street-cars, on trains, and about
vile corners at night. Once, he said, he had seen just one
evil spirit—think of that!—following a certain man all the
time, at his left elbow—a dark, evil, red-eyed thing, until
finally the man had been killed in a quarrel.</p>

<p>Pringle described their shapes, these spirits, as varied.
They were small, dark, irregular clouds, with red or green
spots somewhere for eyes, changing in form and becoming
longish or round like a jellyfish, or even like a misshapen
cat or dog. They could take any form at will—even that
of a man.</p>

<p>Once, Pringle declared, he had seen as many as fifty
about a drunkard who was staggering down a street, all of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
them trying to urge him into the nearest saloon, so that
they might re-experience in some vague way the sensation
of drunkenness, which at some time or other they themselves,
having been drunkards in life, had enjoyed!</p>

<p>It would be the same with a drug fiend, or indeed with
any one of weak or evil habits. They gathered about such
an one like flies, their red or green eyes glowing—attempting
to get something from them, perhaps, if nothing more
than a little sense of their old earth-life.</p>

<p>The whole thing was so terrible and disturbing at the
time, particularly that idea of men being persuaded or influenced
to murder, that he, Davidson, could stand it no
longer, and got up and left. But in his room upstairs he
meditated on it, standing before his mirror. Suddenly—would
he ever forget it—as he was taking off his collar
and tie, he had heard that queer tap, tap, tap, right on his
dressing-table or under it, and for the first time, which
Pringle said, ghosts made when table-rapping in answer to
a call, or to give warning of their presence.</p>

<p>Then something said to him, almost as clearly as if he
heard it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>This is me, Mersereau, come back at last to get you!
Pringle was just an excuse of mine to let you know I was
coming, and so was that hand in that old house, in Issaqueena
County. It was mine! I will be with you from
now on. Don’t think I will ever leave you!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>It had frightened and made him half sick, so wrought
up was he. For the first time he felt cold chills run
up and down his spine—the creeps. He felt as if some
one were standing over him—Mersereau, of course—only
he could not see or hear a thing, just that faint tap at first,
growing louder a little later, and quite angry when he tried
to ignore it.</p>

<p>People did live, then, after they were dead, especially
evil people—people stronger than you, perhaps. They had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
the power to come back, to haunt, to annoy you if they
didn’t like anything you had done to them. No doubt
Mersereau was following him in the hope of revenge, there
in the spirit world, just outside this one, close at his heels,
like that evil spirit attending the other man whom Pringle
had described.</p>


<h3>IV—<span class="smcap">February</span>, 1906</h3>

<p>Take that case of the hand impressed on the soft dough
and plaster of Paris, described in an article that he had
picked up in the dentist’s office out there in Pasadena—Mersereau’s
very hand, so far as he could judge. How
about that for a coincidence, picking up the magazine with
that disturbing article about psychic materialization in
Italy, and later in Berne, Switzerland, where the scientists
were gathered to investigate that sort of thing? And just
when he was trying to rid himself finally of the notion that
any such thing could be!</p>

<p>According to that magazine article, some old crone over
in Italy—spiritualist, or witch, or something—had got together
a crowd of experimentalists or professors in an
abandoned house on an almost deserted island off the coast
of Sardinia. There they had conducted experiments with
spirits, which they called materialization, getting the impression
of the fingers of a hand, or of a whole hand and
arm, or of a face, on a plate of glass covered with soot, the
plate being locked in a small safe on the center of a table
about which they sat!</p>

<p>He, Davidson, couldn’t understand, of course, how it was
done, but done it was. There in that magazine were half a
dozen pictures, reproductions of photographs of a hand, an
arm and a face—or a part of one, anyhow. And if they
looked like anything, they looked exactly like Mersereau’s!
Hadn’t Pringle, there in Gatchard, Miss., stated spirits could
move anywhere, over long distances, with the speed of light.
And would it be any trick for Mersereau to appear there at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
Sardinia, and then engineer this magazine into his presence,
here in Los Angeles? Would it? It would not. Spirits
were free and powerful <em>over there</em>, perhaps.</p>

<p>There was not the least doubt that these hands, these partial
impressions of a face, were those of Mersereau. Those
big knuckles! That long, heavy, humped nose and big jaw!
Whose else could they be?—they were Mersereau’s, intended,
when they were made over there in Italy, for him, Davidson,
to see later here in Los Angeles. Yes, they were! And looking
at that sinister face reproduced in the magazine, it
seemed to say, with Mersereau’s old coarse sneer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>You see? You can’t escape me! I’m showing you how
much alive I am over here, just as I was on earth. And
I’ll get you yet, even if I have to go farther than Italy to
do it!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>It was amazing, the shock he took from that. It wasn’t
just that alone, but the persistence and repetition of this hand
business. What could it mean? Was it really Mersereau’s
hand? As for the face, it wasn’t all there—just the jaw,
mouth, cheek, left temple, and a part of the nose and eye;
but it was Mersereau’s, all right. He had gone clear over
there into Italy somewhere, in a lone house on an island, to
get this message of his undying hate back to him. Or was
it just spirits, evil spirits, bent on annoying him because he
was nervous and sensitive now?</p>


<h3>V—<span class="smcap">October</span>, 1906</h3>

<p>Even new crowded hotels and new buildings weren’t the
protection he had at first hoped and thought they would be.
Even there you weren’t safe—not from a man like Mersereau.
Take that incident there in Los Angeles, and again
in Seattle, only two months ago now, when Mersereau was
able to make that dreadful explosive or crashing sound, as if
one had burst a huge paper bag full of air, or upset a china-closet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
full of glass and broken everything, when as a matter
of fact nothing at all had happened. It had frightened
him horribly the first two or three times, believing as he
did that something fearful had happened. Finding that it
was nothing—or Mersereau—he was becoming used to it
now; but other people, unfortunately, were not.</p>

<p>He would be—as he had been that first time—sitting in
his room perfectly still and trying to amuse himself, or not
to think, when suddenly there would be that awful crash.
It was astounding! Other people heard it, of course. They
had in Los Angeles. A maid and a porter had come running
the first time to inquire, and he had had to protest
that he had heard nothing. They couldn’t believe it at first,
and had gone to other rooms to look. When it happened the
second time, the management had protested, thinking it was
a joke he was playing; and to avoid the risk of exposure he
had left.</p>

<p>After that he could not keep a valet or nurse about him
for long. Servants wouldn’t stay, and managers of hotels
wouldn’t let him remain when such things went on. Yet
he couldn’t live in a house or apartment alone, for there the
noises and atmospheric conditions would be worse than ever.</p>


<h3>VI—<span class="smcap">June</span>, 1907</h3>

<p>Take that last old house he had been in—but never would
be in again!—at Anne Haven. There he actually visualized
the hand—a thing as big as a washtub at first, something like
smoke or shadow in a black room moving about over the bed
and everywhere. Then, as he lay there, gazing at it spellbound,
it condensed slowly, and he began to feel it. It was
now a hand of normal size—there was no doubt of it in the
world—going over him softly, without force, as a ghostly
hand must, having no real physical strength, but all the time
with a strange, electric, secretive something about it, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
it were not quite sure of itself, and not quite sure that he
was really there.</p>

<p>The hand, or so it seemed—God!—moved right up to his
neck and began to feel over that as he lay there. Then it
was that he guessed just what it was that Mersereau was
after.</p>

<p>It was just like a hand, the fingers and thumb made into
a circle and pressed down over his throat, only it moved over
him gently at first, because it really couldn’t do anything yet,
not having the material strength. But the intention! The
sense of cruel, savage determination that went with it!</p>

<p>And yet, if one went to a nerve specialist or doctor about
all this, as he did afterward, what did the doctor say?
He had tried to describe how he was breaking down under
the strain, how he could not eat or sleep on account of all
these constant tappings and noises; but the moment he even
began to hint at his experiences, especially the hand or the
noises, the doctor exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, this is plain delusion! You’re nervously run down,
that’s all that ails you—on the verge of pernicious anemia, I
should say. You’ll have to watch yourself as to this illusion
about spirits. Get it out of your mind. There’s nothing
to it!”</p>

<p>Wasn’t that just like one of these nerve specialists, bound
up in their little ideas of what they knew or saw, or thought
they saw?</p>


<h3>VII—<span class="smcap">November</span>, 1907</h3>

<p>And now take this very latest development at Battle Creek
recently where he had gone trying to recuperate on the diet
there. Hadn’t Mersereau, implacable demon that he was,
developed this latest trick of making his food taste queer to
him—unpalatable, or with an odd odor?</p>

<p>He, Davidson, knew it was Mersereau, for he felt him
beside him at the table whenever he sat down. Besides, he
seemed to hear something—clairaudience was what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
called it, he understood—he was beginning to develop that,
too, now! It was Mersereau, of course, saying in a voice
which was more like a memory of a voice than anything real—the
voice of some one you could remember as having
spoken in a certain way, say, ten years or more ago:</p>

<p>“<em>I’ve fixed it so you can’t eat any more, you—</em>”</p>

<p>There followed a long list of vile expletives, enough in
itself to sicken one.</p>

<p>Thereafter, in spite of anything he could do to make himself
think to the contrary, knowing that the food was all
right, really, Davidson found it to have an odor or a taste
which disgusted him, and which he could not overcome, try
as he would. The management assured him that it was all
right, as he knew it was—for others. He saw them eating
it. But he couldn’t—had to get up and leave, and the little
he could get down he couldn’t retain, or it wasn’t enough for
him to live on. God, he would die, this way! Starve, as he
surely was doing by degrees now.</p>

<p>And Mersereau always seeming to be standing by. Why,
if it weren’t for fresh fruit on the stands at times, and just
plain, fresh-baked bread in bakers’ windows, which he could
buy and eat quickly, he might not be able to live at all. It
was getting to that pass!</p>


<h3>VIII—<span class="smcap">August</span>, 1908</h3>

<p>That wasn’t the worst, either, bad as all that was. The
worst was the fact that under the strain of all this he was
slowly but surely breaking down, and that in the end Mersereau
might really succeed in driving him out of life here—to
do what, if anything, to him there? What? It was
such an evil pack by which he was surrounded, now, those
who lived just on the other side and hung about the earth,
vile, debauched creatures, as Pringle had described them, and
as Davidson had come to know for himself, fearing them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and their ways so much, and really seeing them at times.</p>

<p>Since he had come to be so weak and sensitive, he could see
them for himself—vile things that they were, swimming before
his gaze in the dark whenever he chanced to let himself
be in the dark, which was not often—friends of Mersereau,
no doubt, and inclined to help him just for the evil of it.</p>

<p>For this long time now Davidson had taken to sleeping
with the light on, wherever he was, only tying a handkerchief
over his eyes to keep out some of the glare. Even then
he could see them—queer, misshapen things, for all the world
like wavy, stringy jellyfish or coils of thick, yellowish-black
smoke, moving about, changing in form at times, yet always
looking dirty or vile, somehow, and with those queer, dim,
reddish or greenish glows for eyes. It was sickening!</p>


<h3>IX—<span class="smcap">October</span>, 1908</h3>

<p>Having accomplished so much, Mersereau would by no
means be content to let him go. Davidson knew that! He
could talk to him occasionally now, or at least could hear
him and answer back, if he chose, when he was alone and
quite certain that no one was listening.</p>

<p>Mersereau was always saying, when Davidson would
listen to him at all—which he wouldn’t often—that he
would get him yet, that he would make him pay, or charging
him with fraud and murder.</p>

<p>“<em>I’ll choke you yet!</em>” The words seemed to float in from
somewhere, as if he were remembering that at some time
Mersereau had said just that in his angry, savage tone—not
as if he heard it; and yet he was hearing it of course.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>“<em>I’ll choke you yet! You can’t escape! You may think
you’ll die a natural death, but you won’t, and that’s why I’m
poisoning your food to weaken you. You can’t escape! I’ll
get you, sick or well, when you can’t help yourself, when
you’re sleeping. I’ll choke you, just as you hit me with that
club. That’s why you’re always seeing and feeling this hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
of mine! I’m not alone. I’ve nearly had you many a time
already, only you have managed to wriggle out so far, jumping
up, but some day you won’t be able to—see? Then—</em>”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The voice seemed to die away at times, even in the middle
of a sentence, but at the other times—often, often—he could
hear it completing the full thought. Sometimes he would
turn on the thing and exclaim:</p>

<p>“Oh, go to the devil!” or, “Let me alone!” or, “Shut
up!” Even in a closed room and all alone, such remarks
seemed strange to him, addressed to a ghost; but he couldn’t
resist at times, annoyed as he was. Only he took good care
not to talk if any one was about.</p>

<p>It was getting so that there was no real place for him
outside of an asylum, for often he would get up screaming at
night—he had to, so sharp was the clutch on his throat—and
then always, wherever he was, a servant would come
in and want to know what was the matter. He would have
to say that it was a nightmare—only the management always
requested him to leave after the second or third time, say, or
after an explosion or two. It was horrible!</p>

<p>He might as well apply to a private asylum or sanatorium
now, having all the money he had, and explain that he had
delusions—delusions! Imagine!—and ask to be taken care
of. In a place like that they wouldn’t be disturbed by his
jumping up and screaming at night, feeling that he was
being choked, as he was, or by his leaving the table because
he couldn’t eat the food, or by his talking back to Mersereau,
should they chance to hear him, or by the noises
when they occurred.</p>

<p>They could assign him a special nurse and a special room,
if he wished—only he didn’t wish to be too much alone.
They could put him in charge of some one who would understand
all these things, or to whom he could explain. He
couldn’t expect ordinary people, or hotels catering to ordinary
people, to put up with him any more. Mersereau and his
friends made too much trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>He must go and hunt up a good place somewhere where
they understood such things, or at least tolerated them, and
explain, and then it would all pass for the hallucinations of
a crazy man,—though, as a matter of fact, he wasn’t crazy
at all. It was all too real, only the average or so-called
normal person couldn’t see or hear as he could—hadn’t experienced
what he had.</p>


<h3>X—<span class="smcap">December</span>, 1908</h3>

<p>“The trouble is, doctor, that Mr. Davidson is suffering
from the delusion that he is pursued by evil spirits. He was
not committed here by any court, but came of his own accord
about four months ago, and we let him wander about here at
will. But he seems to be growing worse, as time goes on.</p>

<p>“One of his worst delusions, doctor, is that there is one
spirit in particular who is trying to choke him to death. Dr.
Major, our superintendent, says he has incipient tuberculosis
of the throat, with occasional spasmodic contractions. There
are small lumps or calluses here and there as though caused
by outside pressure and yet our nurse assures us that there is
no such outside irritation. He won’t believe that; but whenever
he tries to sleep, especially in the middle of the night, he
will jump up and come running out into the hall, insisting
that one of these spirits, which he insists are after him, is trying
to choke him to death. He really seems to believe it, for
he comes out coughing and choking and feeling at his neck
as if some one has been trying to strangle him. He always
explains the whole matter to me as being the work of evil
spirits, and asks me to not pay any attention to him unless
he calls for help or rings his call-bell; and so I never think
anything more of it now unless he does.</p>

<p>“Another of his ideas is that these same spirits do something
to his food—put poison in it, or give it a bad odor or
taste, so that he can’t eat it. When he does find anything he
can eat, he grabs it and almost swallows it whole, before, as
he says, the spirits have time to do anything to it. Once, he
says, he weighed more than two hundred pounds, but now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
only weighs one hundred and twenty. His case is exceedingly
strange and pathetic, doctor!</p>

<p>“Dr. Major insists that it is purely a delusion, that so far
as being choked is concerned, it is the incipient tuberculosis,
and that his stomach trouble comes from the same thing; but
by association of ideas, or delusion, he thinks some one is
trying to choke him and poison his food, when it isn’t so at
all. Dr. Major says that he can’t imagine what could have
started it. He is always trying to talk to Mr. Davidson
about it, but whenever he begins to ask him questions, Mr.
Davidson refuses to talk, and gets up and leaves.</p>

<p>“One of the peculiar things about his idea of being choked,
doctor, is that when he is merely dozing he always wakes up
in time, and has the power to throw it off. He claims that
the strength of these spirits is not equal to his own when he
is awake, or even dozing, but when he’s asleep their strength
is greater and that then they may injure him. Sometimes,
when he has had a fright like this, he will come out in the
hall and down to my desk there at the lower end, and ask if
he mayn’t sit there by me. He says it calms him. I always
tell him yes, but it won’t be five minutes before he’ll get up
and leave again, saying that he’s being annoyed, or that he
won’t be able to contain himself if he stays any longer, because
of the remarks being made over his shoulder or in
his ear.</p>

<p>“Often he’ll say: ‘Did you hear that, Miss Liggett?
It’s astonishing, the low, vile things that man can say at
times!’ When I say, ‘No, I didn’t hear,’ he always says,
‘I’m so glad!’”</p>

<p>“No one has ever tried to relieve him of this by hypnotism,
I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of, doctor. Dr. Major may have
tried it. I have only been here three months.”</p>

<p>“Tuberculosis is certainly the cause of the throat trouble,
as Dr. Major says, and as for the stomach trouble, that comes
from the same thing—natural enough under the circumstances.
We may have to resort to hypnotism a little later.
I’ll see. In the meantime you’d better caution all who come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
in touch with him never to sympathize, or even to seem to
believe in anything he imagines is being done to him. It will
merely encourage him in his notions. And get him to take his
medicine regularly; it won’t cure, but it will help. Dr.
Major has asked me to give especial attention to his case,
and I want the conditions as near right as possible.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>


<h3>XI—<span class="smcap">January</span>, 1909</h3>

<p>The trouble with these doctors was that they really knew
nothing of anything save what was on the surface, the little
they had learned at a medical college or in practise—chiefly
how certain drugs, tried by their predecessors in certain cases,
were known to act. They had no imagination whatever,
even when you tried to tell them.</p>

<p>Take that latest young person who was coming here now
in his good clothes and with his car, fairly bursting with his
knowledge of what he called psychiatrics, looking into
Davidson’s eyes so hard and smoothing his temples and
throat—massage, he called it—saying that he had incipient
tuberculosis of the throat and stomach trouble, and utterly
disregarding the things which he, Davidson, could personally
see and hear! Imagine the fellow trying to persuade him,
at this late date, that all that was wrong with him was
tuberculosis, that he didn’t see Mersereau standing right
beside him at times, bending over him, holding up that hand
and telling him how he intended to kill him yet—that it
was all an illusion!</p>

<p>Imagine saying that Mersereau couldn’t actually seize him
by the throat when he was asleep, or nearly so, when Davidson
himself, looking at his throat in the mirror, could see the
actual finger prints,—Mersereau’s,—for a moment or so afterward.
At any rate, his throat was red and sore from being
clutched, as Mersereau of late was able to clutch him! And
that was the cause of these lumps. And to say, as they had
said at first, that he himself was making them by rubbing
and feeling his throat, and that it was tuberculosis!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>Wasn’t it enough to make one want to quit the place? If
it weren’t for Miss Liggett and Miss Koehler, his private
nurse, and their devoted care, he would. That Miss Koehler
was worth her weight in gold, learning his ways as she had,
being so uniformly kind, and bearing with his difficulties
so genially. He would leave her something in his will.</p>

<p>To leave this place and go elsewhere, though, unless he
could take her along, would be folly. And anyway, where
else would he go? Here at least were other people, patients
like himself, who could understand and could sympathize
with him,—people who weren’t convinced as were these
doctors that all that he complained of was mere delusion.
Imagine! Old Rankin, the lawyer, for instance, who had
suffered untold persecution from one living person and another,
mostly politicians, was convinced that his, Davidson’s,
troubles were genuine, and liked to hear about them, just as
did Miss Koehler. These two did not insist, as the doctors
did, that he had slow tuberculosis of the throat, and could
live a long time and overcome his troubles if he would.
They were merely companionable at such times as Mersereau
would give him enough peace to be sociable.</p>

<p>The only real trouble, though, was that he was growing so
weak from lack of sleep and food—his inability to eat the
food which his enemy bewitched and to sleep at night on
account of the choking—that he couldn’t last much longer.
This new physician whom Dr. Major had called into consultation
in regard to his case was insisting that along with
his throat trouble he was suffering from acute anemia, due
to long undernourishment, and that only a solution of
strychnin injected into the veins would help him. But as to
Mersereau poisoning his food—not a word would he hear.
Besides, now that he was practically bedridden, not able to
jump up as freely as before, he was subject to a veritable
storm of bedevilment at the hands of Mersereau. Not only
could he see—especially toward evening, and in the very
early hours of the morning—Mersereau hovering about him
like a black shadow, a great, bulky shadow—yet like him in
outline, but he could feel his enemy’s hand moving over him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
Worse, behind or about him he often saw a veritable cloud
of evil creatures, companions or tools of Mersereau’s, who
were there to help him and who kept swimming about like
fish in dark waters, and seemed to eye the procedure with
satisfaction.</p>

<p>When food was brought to him, early or late, and in
whatever form, Mersereau and they were there, close at
hand, as thick as flies, passing over and through it in an
evident attempt to spoil it before he could eat it. Just to see
them doing it was enough to poison it for him. Besides, he
could hear their voices urging Mersereau to do it.</p>

<p>“<em>That’s right—poison it!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>He can’t last much longer!</em>”</p>

<p>“<em>Soon he’ll be weak enough so that when you grip him
he will really die!</em>”</p>

<p>It was thus that they actually talked—he could hear them.</p>

<p>He also heard vile phrases addressed to him by Mersereau,
the iterated and reiterated words “murderer” and
“swindler” and “cheat,” there in the middle of the night.
Often, although the light was still on, he saw as many as
seven dark figures, very much like Mersereau’s, although
different, gathered close about him,—like men in consultation—evil
men. Some of them sat upon his bed, and it
seemed as if they were about to help Mersereau to finish
him, adding their hands to his.</p>

<p>Behind them again was a complete circle of all those evil,
swimming things with green and red eyes, always watching—helping,
probably. He had actually felt the pressure of
the hand to grow stronger of late, when they were all there.
Only, just before he felt he was going to faint, and because
he could not spring up any more, he invariably screamed or
gasped a choking gasp and held his finger on the button
which would bring Miss Koehler. Then she would come,
lift him up, and fix his pillows. She also always assured him
that it was only the inflammation of his throat, and rubbed
it with alcohol, and gave him a few drops of something internally
to ease it.</p>

<p>After all this time, and in spite of anything he could tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
them, they still believed, or pretended to believe, that he
was suffering from tuberculosis, and that all the rest of this
was delusion, a phase of insanity!</p>

<p>And Mersereau’s skeleton still out there on the Monte
Orte!</p>

<p>And Mersereau’s plan, with the help of others, of course,
was to choke him to death, there was no doubt of that now;
and yet they would believe after he was gone that he had
died of tuberculosis of the throat. Think of that.</p>


<h3>XII—<span class="smcap">Midnight of February</span> 10, 1909</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The Ghost of Mersereau</span> (<em>bending over Davidson</em>):
“Softly! Softly! He’s quite asleep! He didn’t
think we could get him—that I could! But this time,—yes.
Miss Koehler is asleep at the end of the hall and Miss
Liggett can’t come, can’t hear. He’s too weak now. He
can scarcely move or groan. Strengthen my hand, will you!
I will grip him so tight this time that he won’t get away!
His cries won’t help him this time! He can’t cry as he once
did! Now! Now!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Cloud of Evil Spirits</span> (<em>swimming about</em>): “Right!
Right! Good! Good! Now! Ah!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Davidson</span> (<em>waking, choking, screaming, and feebly striking
out</em>): “Help! Help! H-e-l-p! Miss—Miss—H—e—l—p!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Liggett</span> (<em>dozing heavily in her chair</em>): “Everything
is still. No one restless. I can sleep.” (Her head nods.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Cloud of Evil Spirits</span>: “Good! Good! Good!
His soul at last! Here it comes! He couldn’t escape this
time! Ah! Good! Good! Now!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mersereau</span> (<em>to Davidson</em>): “You murderer! At last!
At last!”</p>


<h3>XIII—3 <span class="smcap">A.M. of February</span> 17, 1909</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Koehler</span> (<em>at the bedside, distressed and pale</em>): “He
must have died some time between one and two, doctor. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
left him at one o’clock, comfortable as I could make him.
He said he was feeling as well as could be expected. He’s
been very weak during the last few days, taking only a
little gruel. Between half past one and two I thought I
heard a noise, and came to see. He was lying just as you
see here, except that his hands were up to his throat, as if
it were hurting or choking him. I put them down for
fear they would stiffen that way. In trying to call one of
the other nurses just now, I found that the bell was out
of order, although I know it was all right when I left,
because he always made me try it. So he may have tried
to ring.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Major</span> <em>(turning the head and examining the
throat</em>): “It looks as if he had clutched at his throat rather
tightly this time, I must say. Here is the mark of his
thumb on this side and of his four fingers on the other.
Rather deep for the little strength he had. Odd that he
should have imagined that some one else was trying to choke
him, when he was always pressing at his own neck! Throat
tuberculosis is very painful at times. That would explain
the desire to clutch at his throat.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Liggett</span>: “He was always believing that an evil
spirit was trying to choke him, doctor.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Major</span>: “Yes, I know—association of ideas. Dr.
Scain and I agree as to that. He had a bad case of chronic
tuberculosis of the throat, with accompanying malnutrition,
due to the effect of the throat on the stomach; and his
notion about evil spirits pursuing him and trying to choke
him was simply due to an innate tendency on the part of the
subconscious mind to join things together—any notion, say,
with any pain. If he had had a diseased leg, he would have
imagined that evil spirits were attempting to saw it off,
or something like that. In the same way the condition of
his throat affected his stomach, and he imagined that the
spirits were doing something to his food. Make out a
certificate showing acute tuberculosis of the esophagus as the
cause, with delusions of persecution as his mental condition.
While I am here we may as well look in on Mr. Baff.”</p>

CHAINS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">As</span> Garrison left his last business conference in K——,
where the tall buildings, and the amazing crowds always
seemed such a commentary on the power and force and
wealth of America and the world, and was on his way to the
railway station to take a train for G——, his home city, his
thoughts turned with peculiar emphasis and hope, if not
actual pleasure—and yet it was a pleasure, of a sad, distressed
kind—to Idelle. Where was she now? What was
she doing at this particular moment? It was after four of a
gray November afternoon, just the time, as he well knew,
winter or summer, when she so much preferred to be glowing
at an afternoon reception, a “thé dansant,” or a hotel
grill where there was dancing, and always, as he well knew,
in company with those vivid young “sports” or pleasure
lovers of the town who were always following her. Idelle,
to do her no injustice, had about her that something, even
after three years of marriage, that drew them, some of the
worst or best—mainly the worst, he thought at times—of
those who made his home city, the great far-flung G——,
interesting and in the forefront socially and in every other
way.</p>

<p>What a girl! What a history! And how strange that
he should have been attracted to her at all, he with his
forty-eight years, his superior (oh, very much!) social position,
his conservative friends and equally conservative manners.
Idelle was so different, so hoyden, almost coarse, in
her ways at times, actually gross and vulgar (derived from
her French tanner father, no doubt, not her sweet, retiring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
Polish mother), and yet how attractive, too, in so many
ways, with that rich russet-brown-gold hair of hers, her
brown-black eyes, almost pupil-less, the iris and pupil being
of the same color, and that trig, vigorous figure, always
tailored in the smartest way! She was a paragon—to him
at least—or had been to begin with.</p>



<p><em>How tingling and dusty these streets of K—— were, so
vital always! How sharply the taxis of this mid-Western
city turned corners!</em></p>



<p>But what a period he had endured since he had married
her, three years before! What tortures, what despairs!
If only he could make over Idelle to suit him! But what a
wonderful thing that destroying something called beauty
was, especially to one, like himself, who found life tiresome
in so many ways—something to possess, a showpiece
against the certain inroads of time, something wherewith to
arouse envy in other persons.</p>



<p><em>At last they were reaching the station!</em></p>



<p>She did not deserve that he should love her. It was the
most unfortunate thing for him that he did, but how
could he help it now? How overcome it? How punish
her for her misdeeds to him without punishing himself
more? Love was such an inscrutable thing; so often one
lavished it where it was not even wanted. God, he could
testify to that! He was a fine example, really. She cared
about as much for him as she did for the lamp-post on the
corner, or an old discarded pair of shoes. And yet— He
was never tired of looking at her, for one thing, of thinking
of her ways, her moods, her secrets. She had not done and
was not doing as she should—it was impossible, he was
beginning to suspect, for her so to do—and still—</p>



<p><em>He must stop and send her a telegram before the train left!</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>



<p>What a pleasure it was, indeed, anywhere and at all
times, to have her hanging on his arm, to walk into a
restaurant or drawing-room and to know that of all those
present none had a more attractive wife than he, not one.
For all Idelle’s commonplace birth and lack of position to
begin with, she was the smartest, the best dressed, the most
alluring, by far—at least, he thought so—of all the set in
which he had placed her. Those eyes! That hair! That
graceful figure, always so smartly arrayed! To be sure,
she was a little young for him. Their figures side by side
were somewhat incongruous—he with his dignity and years
and almost military bearing, as so many told him, she with
that air of extreme youthfulness and lure which always
brought so many of the younger set to her side wherever
they happened to be. Only there was the other galling
thought: That she did not wholly belong to him and
never had. She was too interested in other men, and always
had been. Her youth, that wretched past of hers,
had been little more than a lurid streak of bad, even evil—yes,
evil—conduct. She had, to tell the truth, been a vile
girl, sensuous, selfish, inconsiderate, unrepentant, and was
still, and yet he had married her in spite of all that, knowing
it, really. Only at first he had not known quite all.</p>



<p>“<em>Yes, all three of these! And wait till I get my sleeper
ticket!</em>”</p>



<p>No wonder people had talked, though. He had heard it—that
she had married him for his money, position, that he
was too old, that it was a scandal, etc. Well, maybe it was.
But he had been fond of her—terribly so—and she of him,
or seemingly, at first. Yes, she must have been—her manner,
her enthusiasm, if temporary, for him! Those happy,
happy first days they spent together! Her quiet assumption
of the rôle of hostess in Sicard Avenue at first, her manner
of receiving and living up to her duties! It was wonderful,
so promising. Yes, there was no doubt of it; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
must have cared for him a little at first. Her brain, too,
required a man of his years to understand—some phases of
her moods and ideas, and as for him—well, he was as crazy
about her then as now—more so, if anything—or was he?
Wasn’t she just as wonderful to him now as she had been
then? Truly. Yes, love or infatuation of this kind was a
terrible thing, so impossible to overcome.</p>



<p>“<em>Car three, section seven!</em>”</p>



<p>Would he ever forget the night he had first seen her being
carried into the Insull General on that canvas ambulance
stretcher, her temple bruised, one arm broken and internal
injuries for which she had to be operated on at once—a
torn diaphragm, for one thing—and of how she had instantly
fascinated him? Her hair was loose and had fallen
over one shoulder, her hands limp. Those hands! That
picture! He had been visiting his old friend Dr. Dorsey
and had wondered who she was, how she came to be in
such a dreadful accident and thought her so beautiful.
Think of how her beauty might have been marred, only it
wasn’t, thank goodness!</p>



<p><em>His telegram should be delivered in one hour, at most—that
would reach her in time!</em></p>



<p>Then and there he had decided that he must know her if
she did not die, that perhaps she might like him as he did
her, on the instant; had actually suffered tortures for fear
she would not! Think of that! Love at first sight for
him—and for one who had since caused him so much suffering—and
in her condition, torn and bruised and near to
death! It was wonderful, wasn’t it?</p>



<p><em>How stuffy these trains were when one first entered them—coal
smoky!</em></p>



<p>And that operation! What a solemn thing it was, really,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
with only himself, the doctor and three nurses in the empty
operating room that night. Dorsey was so tall, so solemn,
but always so courageous. He had asked if he might not be
present, although he did not know her, and because there
were no relatives about to bar him from the room, no one to
look after her or to tell who she was, the accident having
occurred after midnight in the suburbs, he had been allowed
by Dorsey to come in.</p>



<p>“<em>Yes, put them down here!</em>”</p>



<p>He had pulled on a white slip over his business suit, and
clean white cotton gloves on his hands, and had then been
allowed to come into the observation gallery while Dorsey,
assisted by the hospital staff, had operated. He saw her cut
open—the blood—heard her groan heavily under ether!
And all the time wondering who she was. Her history.
And pitying her, too! Fearing she might not come to! How
the memory of her pretty shrewd face, hidden under bandages
and a gas cone, had haunted him!</p>



<p><em>The train on this other track, its windows all polished,
its dining-car tables set and its lamps already glowing!</em></p>



<p>That was another of those fool dreams of his—of love
and happiness, that had tortured him so of late. From the
first, almost without quite knowing it, he had been bewitched,
stricken with this fever, and could not possibly
think of her dying. And afterward, with her broken
arm set and her torn diaphragm mended, he had followed
her into the private room which he had ordered and
had charged to himself (Dorsey must have thought it
queer!) and then had waited so restlessly at his club until
the next morning, when, standing beside her bed, he had
said: “You don’t know me, but my name is Garrison—Upham
Brainerd Garrison. Perhaps you know of our
family here in G——, the Willard Garrisons. I saw you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
brought in last night. I want to be of service to you if
I may, to notify your friends, and be of any other use that
I can. May I?”</p>

<p>How well he remembered saying that, formulating it
all beforehand, and then being so delighted when she accepted
his services with a peculiar, quizzical smile—that
odd, evasive glance of hers!</p>



<p><em>Men struck car wheels this way, no doubt, in order to
see that they were not broken, liable to fly to pieces when
the train was running fast and so destroy the lives of all!</em></p>



<p>And then she had given him her address—her mother’s,
rather, to whom he went at once, bringing her back with
him. And so glad he was to know that there was only her
mother, no husband or— And the flowers he had sent. And
the fruit. And the gifts generally, everything he thought
she might like! And then that queer friendship with Idelle
afterwards, his quickly realized dream of bliss when she had
let him call on her daily, not telling him anything of herself,
of course, evading him rather, and letting him think what he
would, but tolerating him! Yes, she had played her game
fair enough, no doubt, only he was so eager to believe that
everything was going to be perfect with them—smooth,
easy, lasting, bliss always. What a fool of love he really was!</p>



<p><em>What a disgusting fat woman coming in with all her
bags! Would this train never start?</em></p>



<p>At that time—how sharply it had all burned itself into
his memory!—he had found her living as a young widow
with her baby daughter at her mother’s, only she wasn’t a
widow really. It was all make-believe. Already she had
proved a riant scoffer at the conventions, a wastrel, only
then he did not know that. Where he thought he was
making an impression on a fairly unsophisticated girl, or
at least one not roughly used by the world, in reality he
was merely a new sensation to her, an incident, a convenience,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
something to lift her out of a mood or a dilemma
in which she found herself. Although he did not know
it then, one of two quarreling men had just attempted to
kill her via that automobile accident and she had been wishing
peace, escape from her own thoughts and the attentions
of her two ardent wooers, for the time being, at the time he
met her. But apart from these, even, there were others, or
had been before them, a long line apparently of almost disgusting—but
no, he could not say quite that—creatures with
whom she had been—well, why say it? And he had fancied
for the moment that he was the big event in her life—or
might be! He!</p>

<p>But even so, what difference did all that make either, if
only she would love him now? What would he care who
or what she was, or what she had done before, if only she
really cared for him as much as he cared for her—or half as
much—or even a minute portion! But Idelle could never
care for any one really, or at least not for him, or him alone,
anyway. She was too restless, too fond of variety in life.
Had she not, since the first six or seven months in which she
had known and married him, little more than tolerated
him? She did not really need to care for anybody; they all
cared for her, sought her.</p>



<p><em>At last they were going!</em></p>



<p>Too many men of station and means—younger than himself,
as rich or richer, far more clever and fascinating in
every way than he would ever be (or she would think so because
she really liked a gayer, smarter type than he had ever
been or ever could be now)—vied with him for her interest,
and had with each other before ever he came on the scene.
She was, in her queer way, a child of fortune, a genius of
passion and desire, really. Life would use her well for some
time yet, whatever she did to him or any other person, or
whatever he sought to do to her in revenge, if he ever did,
because she was interesting and desirable. Why attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
deny that? She was far too attractive yet, too clever, too
errant, too indifferent, too spiritually free, to be neglected by
any one yet, let alone by such seeking, avid, pleasure lovers as
always followed her. And because she wouldn’t allow him to
interfere (that was the basis on which she had agreed to
marry him, her personal freedom) she had always been able
to go and do and be what she chose, nearly, just as she was
going and doing now.</p>



<p><em>These wide yards and that ruck of shabby yellow-and-black
houses, begrimed and dirty externally, and internally
no doubt, with souls in them nearly as drab, perhaps. How
much better it was to be rich like himself and Idelle; only
she valued her station so lightly!</em></p>



<p>Always, wherever he went these days, and his affairs
prevented him from being with her very much, she was in
his mind—what she was doing, where she was going, with
whom she might be now—ah, the sickening thought, with
whom she might be now, and where—with that young
waster Keene, possibly, with his millions, his shooting preserve
and his yacht; or Browne, equally young and still in
evidence, though deserted by her to marry him, Garrison; or
Coulstone, with whom Idelle had had that highly offensive
affair in Pittsburgh five years before, when she was only
eighteen. Eighteen! The wonder year! He, too, was
here in G—— now after all these years, this same Coulstone,
and after Idelle had left him once! Yes, he was hanging
about her again, wanting her to come back and marry him,
although each of them had remarried!</p>



<p><em>That flock of crows flying across that distant field!</em></p>



<p>Of course, Idelle laughed at it, or pretended to. She pretended
to be faithful to him, to tell him all this was unavoidable
gossip, the aftermath of a disturbing past, before
ever she saw him. But could he believe her? Was she not
really planning so to do—leave him and return to Coulstone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
this time legally? How could he tell? But think of the
vagaries of human nature and character, the conniving and
persuasive power of a man of wealth like Coulstone. He
had left his great business in Pittsburgh to come here to
G—— in order to be near her and annoy him (Garrison)
really—not her, perhaps—with his pleas and crazy fascination
and adoration when she was now safely and apparently
happily married! Think of the strangeness, the shame, the
peculiarity of Idelle’s earlier life! And she still insisted that
this sort of thing was worth while! All his own station and
wealth and adoration were not enough—because he could
not be eight or ten people at once, no doubt. But why
should he worry? Why not let her go? To the devil with
her, anyhow! She merely pretended to love him in her idle,
wanton spirit, because she could—well, because she could
play at youth and love!</p>



<p><em>Barkersburg—a place of 30,000, and the train not stopping!
The sun, breaking through for just one peep at this
gray day, under those trees!</em></p>



<p>The trouble with his life, as Garrison now saw it, was
that throughout it for the last twenty years, and before that
even, in spite of his youth and money, he had been craving
the favor of just such a young, gay, vigorous, attractive
creature as Idelle or Jessica—she of his earlier years—and
not realizing it, until he met Idelle, his desire. And this, of
course, had placed him at a disadvantage in dealing with
women like them. Years before—all of fourteen now, think
of it!—there had been that affair between himself and Jessica,
daughter of the rich and fashionable Balloghs, of Lexington,
which had ended so disastrously for him. He had
been out there on Colonel Ledgebrook’s estate attending to
some property which belonged to his father when she had
crossed his path at the colonel’s house, that great estate in
Bourbon County. Then, for the first time really, he had
realized the delight of having a truly beautiful girl interested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
in him, and him alone, of being really attracted to him—for
a little while. It was wonderful.</p>



<p><em>The smothered clang of that crossing bell!</em></p>



<p>But also what a failure! How painful to hark back to
that, and yet how could he avoid it? Although it had
seemed to end so favorably—he having been able to win
and marry her—still in reality it had ended most disastrously,
she having eventually left him as she did. Jessica,
too, was like Idelle in so many ways, as young, as gay, nearly
as forceful, not as pretty, and not with Idelle’s brains. You
had to admit that in connection with Idelle. She had more
brains, force, self-reliance, intuition, than most women he
knew anything about, young or old.</p>

<p>But to return to Jessica. At first she seemed to think he
was wonderful, a man of the world, clever, witty, a lover
of light, frivolous, foolish things, such as dancing, drinking,
talking idle nonsense, which he was not at all. Yes, that
was where he had always failed, apparently, and always
would. He had no flair, and clever women craved that.</p>



<p><em>That flock of pigeons on that barn roof!</em></p>



<p>At bottom really he had always been slow, romantic,
philosophic, meditative, while trying in the main to appear
something else, whereas these other men, those who
were so successful with women at least, were hard and gay
and quick and thoughtless, or so he thought. They said
and did things more by instinct than he ever could, were
successful—well, just because they were what they were.
You couldn’t do those things by just trying to. And gay,
pretty, fascinating women, such as Idelle or Jessica, the
really worthwhile ones, seemed to realize this instinctively
and to like that kind and no other. When they found a
sober and reflective man like himself, or one even inclined
to be, they drew away from him. Yes, they did; not consciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
always, but just instinctively. They wanted only
men who tingled and sparkled and glittered like themselves.
To think that love must always go by blind instinct instead
of merit—genuine, adoring passion!</p>



<p><em>This must be Phillipsburg coming into view! He couldn’t
mistake that high, round water tower!</em></p>



<p>Ah, the tragedy of seeing and knowing this and not being
able to remedy it, of not being able to make oneself over
into something like that! Somehow, Jessica had been betrayed
by his bog-fire resemblance to the thing which she
took him to be. He was a bog fire and nothing more, in
so far as she was concerned, all she thought he was. Yet
because he was so hungry, no doubt, for a woman of her
type he had pretended that he was “the real thing,” as she
so liked to describe a gay character, a man of habits, bad or
good, as you choose; one who liked to gamble, shoot, race,
and do a lot of things which he really did not care for at all,
but which the crowd or group with which he was always
finding himself, or with whom he hoped to appear as somebody,
was always doing and liking.</p>



<p><em>These poor countrymen, always loitering about their
village stations!</em></p>



<p>And the women they ran with were just like them, like
Jessica, like Idelle—smart, showy and liked that sort of man—and
so—</p>

<p>Well, he had pretended to be all that and more, when
she (Jessica) had appeared out of that gay group, petite,
blonde (Idelle was darker), vivacious, drawn to him by his
seeming reality as a man of the world and a gay cavalier.
She had actually fallen in love with him at sight, as it were,
or seemed to be at the time—she!—and then, see what had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
happened! Those awful months in G—— after she had
returned with him! The agonies of mind and body!</p>



<p><em>If only that stout traveling man in that gray suit would
cease staring at him! It must be the horn-rimmed glasses
he had on which interested him so! These mid-Western
people!</em></p>



<p>Instantly almost, only a few weeks after they were
married, she seemed to realize that she had made a mistake.
It seemed not to make the slightest difference to her,
after the first week or so, that they were married or that
he was infatuated with her or that he was who he was or
that her every move and thought were beautiful to him. On
the contrary, it seemed only to irritate her all the more.
She seemed to sense then—not before—that he was really
the one man not suited to her by temperament or taste or
ideas, not the kind she imagined she was getting, and from
then on there were the most terrible days, terrible—</p>



<p><em>That pretty girl turning in at that village gate!</em></p>



<p>Trying, depressing, degrading really. What dark frowns
used to flash across her face like clouds at that time—she
was nineteen to his twenty-four, and so pretty!—the realization,
perhaps, that she had made a mistake. What she
really wanted was the gay, anachronistic, unthinking,
energetic person he had seemed to be under the stress of
the life at Ledgebrook’s, not the quiet, reasoning, dreamy
person he really was. It was terrible!</p>



<p><em>Tall trees made such shadowy aisles at evening!</em></p>



<p>Finally she had run away, disappeared completely one
morning after telling him she was going shopping, and
then never seeing him any more—ever—not even once!
A telegram from Harrisburg had told him that she was going<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
to her mother’s and for him not to follow her, please; and
then before he could make up his mind really what to do
had come that old wolf Caldwell, the famous divorce lawyer
of G——, representing her mother, no doubt, and in smooth,
ingratiating, persuasive tones had talked about the immense
folly of attempting to adjust natural human antipathies, the
sadness of all human inharmonies, the value of quiet in all
attempts at separation, the need he had to look after his
own social prestige in G——, and the like, until finally
Caldwell had persuaded him to accept a decree of desertion
in some Western state in silence and let her go out of his
life forever! Think of that!</p>



<p><em>The first call for dinner! Perhaps he had better go at
once and have it over with! He wanted to retire early
to-night!</em></p>



<p>But Jessica—how she had haunted him for years after
that! The whole city seemed to suggest her at times, even
after he heard that she was married again and the mother
of two children, so strong was the feeling for anything one
lost. Even to this day certain corners in G——, the Brandingham,
where they had lived temporarily at first; Mme.
Gateley’s dressmaking establishment, where she had had
her gowns made, and the Tussockville entrance to the park—always
touched and hurt him like some old, dear, poignant
melody.</p>



<p><em>How this train lurched as one walked! The crashing
couplings between these cars!</em></p>



<p>And then, after all these busy, sobering years, in which
he had found out that there were some things he was not
and could not be—a gay, animal man of the town, for instance,
a “blood,” a waster; and some things that he was—a
fairly capable financial and commercial man, a lover of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
literature of sorts, and of horses, a genial and acceptable
person in many walks of society—had come Idelle.</p>



<p><em>Think of the dining-car being crowded thus early! And
such people!</em></p>



<p>He was just settling down to a semi-resigned acceptance
of himself as an affectional, emotional failure in so far as
women were concerned, when she had come—Idelle—this
latest storm which had troubled him so much. Idelle had
brains, beauty, force, insight—more than Jessica ever had
had, or was he just older?—and that was what made her so
attractive to men, so indifferent to women, so ready to
leave him to do all the worshiping. She could understand
him, apparently, at his time of life, with his sober and in
some ways sad experiences, and sympathize with him most
tenderly when she chose, and yet, strangely enough, she
could ignore him also and be hard, cruel, indifferent. The
way she could neglect him at times—go her own way!
God!</p>



<p><em>Not a bad seat, only now it was too dark to see anything
outside! These heavy forks!</em></p>



<p>But to return to that dreadful pagan youth of hers, almost
half-savage: take that boy who shot himself at the
age of sixteen for love of her, and all because she would not
run away with him, not caring for him at all, as
she said, or she would have gone! What a sad case
that was, as she had told it, at least. The boy’s
father had come and denounced her to her parents in
her own home, according to her, and still she denied that it
had been her fault. And those other two youths, one of
whom had embezzled $10,000 and spent it on her and several
other boys and girls! And that other one who had
stolen five hundred in small sums from his father’s till and
safe and then wasted it on her and her companions at country
inns until he was caught! Those country clubs! Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
little rivers she described, with their canoes—the automobiles
of these youths—the dancing, eating, drinking life
under the moon in the warmth of spring and summer under
the trees! And he had never had anything like that, never!
When one of the boys, being caught, complained of her to
his parents as the cause of his evil ways she had denied it, or
so she said, and did still to this day, saying she really did
not know he was stealing the money and calling him coward
or cry-baby. Idelle told him of this several years ago as
though it had some humorous aspects, as possibly it had, to
her—who knows? but with some remorse, too, for she was
not wholly indifferent to the plight of these youths, although
she contended that what she had given them of her time and
youth and beauty was ample compensation. Yes, she was a
bad woman, really, or had been—a bad girl, say what one
would, a child of original evil impulse. One could not deny
that really. But what fascination also, even yet, and then
no doubt—terrible! He could understand the actions of
those youths, their recklessness. There was something about
sheer beauty, evil though it might be, which overcame moral
prejudices or scruples. It had done so in his case, or why
was he living with her? And so why not in theirs?</p>



<p><em>How annoying to have a train stop in a station while you
were eating!</em></p>



<p>Beauty, beauty, beauty! How could one gainsay the
charm or avoid the lure of it? Not he, for one. Trig,
beautiful women, who carried themselves with an air and
swing and suggested by their every movement passion,
alertness, gayety of mind! The church bells might ring and
millions of religionists preach of a life hereafter with a fixed
table of rewards and punishments, but what did any one
know of the future, anyhow? Nothing! Exactly nothing,
in spite of all the churches. Life appeared and disappeared
again; a green door opened and out you went, via a train
wreck, for instance, on a night like this. All these farmers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
here tilling their fields and making their little homes and
towns—where would they be in forty or fifty years, with
all their moralities? No, here and now was life, here and
now beauty—here and now Idelle, or creatures like her and
Jessica.</p>



<p><em>He would pay his bill and go into the smoker for a
change. It would be pleasant to sit there until his berth
was made up.</em></p>



<p>Then, take that affair of the banker’s son, young Gratiot
it was, whom he knew well even now here in G——, only
Gratiot did not know that he knew—or did he? Perhaps
he was still friendly with Idelle, although she denied it.
You could never really believe her. He it was, according
to her, who had captured her fancy with his fine airs and
money and car when she was only seventeen, and then
robbed her (or could you call it robbery in Idelle’s case,
seeking, restless creature that she was?) of her indifferent innocence.
No robbery there, surely, whatever she might say.</p>



<p><em>Those fascinating coke ovens blazing in the dark beside
the track, mile after mile!</em></p>



<p>Somehow her telling him these things at first, or rather
shortly after they were married and when she was going to
make a clean breast of everything and lead a better life, had
thrown a wonderful glamour over her past.</p>



<p><em>“Gay Stories”! What a name for a magazine! And
that stout old traveling man reading it!</em></p>



<p>What a strange thing it was to be a girl like that—with
passions and illusions like that! Perhaps, after all, life
only came to those who sought it with great strength and
natural gifts. But how hard it was on those who hadn’t
anything of that kind! Nevertheless, people should get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
over the follies of their youth—Idelle should, anyhow. She
had had enough, goodness knows. She had been one of the
worst—hectic, vastly excited about life, irresponsible—and
she should have sobered by now. Why not? Look at all
he had to offer her! Was that not enough to effect a
change? While it made her interesting at times, this left-over
enthusiasm, still it was so ridiculous, and made her
non-desirable, too, either as wife or mother. Yet no doubt
that was what had made her so fascinating to him, too, at
this late day and to all those other men in B—— and elsewhere—that
blazing youthfulness. Strange as it might
seem, he could condone Idelle’s dreadful deeds even now,
just as her mother could, if she would only behave herself,
if she would only love him and him alone—but would she?
She seemed so determined to bend everything to her service,
regardless,—to yield nothing to him.</p>



<p><em>No use! He couldn’t stand these traveling men in this
smoking room! He must have the porter make up his
berth!</em></p>



<p>And then had come Coulstone, the one who was still
hanging about her now, the one with whom she had had
that dreadful affair in Pittsburgh, the affair that always
depressed him to think about even now. Of course, there
was one thing to be said in extenuation of that, if you could
say anything at all—which you couldn’t really—and that
was that Idelle was no longer a good girl then, but experienced
and with all her blazing disposition aroused. She had
captured the reins of her life then and was doing as she
pleased—only why couldn’t he have met her then instead of
Coulstone? He was alive then. And his own life had always
been so empty. When she had confessed so much of
all this to him afterward—not this Coulstone affair exactly,
but the other things—why hadn’t he left her then? He
might have and saved himself all this agony—or could he
have then? He was twice her age when he married her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
and knew better, only he thought he could reform her—or
did he? Was that the true reason? Could he admit the
true reason to himself?</p>



<p><em>“Yes, make it up right away, if you will!” Now he
would have to wait about and be bored!</em></p>



<p>But to come back to the story of Coulstone and all that
hectic life in Pittsburgh. Coulstone, it seems, had been one
of four or five very wealthy young managing vice-presidents
of the Iverson-Centelever Frog and Switch Company, of
Pittsburgh. And Idelle, because her father had suddenly died
after her affair with young Gratiot, never knowing a thing
about it, and her mother, not knowing quite what to do
with her, had (because Idelle seemed to wish it) sent her
to stay with an aunt in Pittsburgh. But the aunt having to
leave for a time shortly after Idelle reached there, a girl
friend had, at Idelle’s instigation, apparently, suggested
that she stay with her until the aunt’s return, and Idelle had
then persuaded her mother to agree to that.</p>



<p><em>That tall, lanky girl having to sleep in that upper berth
opposite! European sleeping cars were so much better!</em></p>



<p>Her girl friend was evidently something like Idelle, or
even worse. At any rate, Idelle appeared to have been able
to wind her around her finger. For through her she had
found some method of being introduced to (or letting them
introduce themselves) a few of these smart new-rich men
of the town, among them two of these same vice-presidents,
one of whom was Coulstone. According to Idelle, he was a
lavish and even reckless spender, wanting it to appear generally
that he could do anything and have anything that
money could buy, and liking to be seen in as many as a
dozen public places in one afternoon or evening, especially
at week-ends, only there weren’t so many in Pittsburgh at
the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>



<p><em>This must be Centerfield, the state capital of E——,
they were now passing without a pause! These expresses
cut through so many large cities!</em></p>



<p>From the first, so Idelle said, he had made violent love
to her, though he was already married (unhappily, of
course), and she, caring nothing for the conventions and
not being of the kind that obeys any laws (wilful, passionate,
reckless), had received him probably in exactly the
spirit in which he approached her, if not more so. That
was the worst of her, her constant, wilful, pagan pursuit of
pleasure, regardless of anybody or anything, and it still
held her in spite of him. There was something revolting
about the sheer animality of it, that rushing together of
two people, regardless. Still, if it had been himself and
Idelle now—</p>



<p><em>How fortunate that he had been able to obtain a section!
At least he would have air!</em></p>



<p>There had been a wild season, according to her own admissions
or boastings—he could never quite tell which—extending
over six or seven months, during which time Idelle
had pretended to her mother, so she said, to prefer to live
with her girl friend rather than return home. She had had,
according to her, her machine, her servants, clothes without
end, and what-not—a dream-world of luxury and freedom
which he had provided and from which she never expected
to wake, and her mother totally ignorant of it all the
while! There had been everything she wished at her finger
tips—hectic afternoons, evenings and midnights; affairs at
country clubs or hotel grills, where the young bloods of the
city and their girls congregated; wild rides in automobiles;
visits to the nearest smartest watering-places, and the like.
Or was she lying? He could scarcely think so, judging
by her career with him and others since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>



<p><em>Ah, what a comfort to fix oneself this way and rest,
looking at the shadowy moonlit landscape passing by!</em></p>



<p>Idelle had often admitted or boasted that she had been
wildly happy—that was the worst of it—that she had not
quite realized what she was doing, but that she had no remorse
either, even now—that she had lived! (And why
should she have, perhaps? Weren’t all people really selfish
at bottom—or were they?) Only, owing to her almost insatiable
pagan nature, there were other complications right
then and there—think of that!—an older rival millionaire,
if you please, richer by far than Coulstone, and more influential
locally ... and younger ones, too, who sought
her but really did not win her, she having no time or plan
for them. As it happened, the older one, having been
worsted in the contest but being partially tolerated by her,
had become frantically jealous and envious, although “he
had no right,” as she said, and had finally set about making
trouble for the real possessor, and succeeded to the extent
of exposing him and eventually driving him out of the
great concern with which he was connected and out of
Pittsburgh, too, if you please, on moral grounds (?), although
he himself was trying to follow in Coulstone’s footsteps!
And all for the love or possession of a nineteen-year-old
girl, a petticoat, a female ne’er-do-well! How little the
world in general knew of such things—and it was a blessed
thing, too, by George! Where would things be if everybody
went on like that?</p>



<p><em>The rhythmic clack of these wheels and trucks over these
sleeper joints—a poetic beat, of sorts!</em></p>



<p>But Idelle was so naïve about all this now, or pretended
to be, so careless of what he or any one else might think in
case they ever found out. She did not seem to guess how
much he might suffer by her telling him all this, or how
much pain thinking about it afterward might cause him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
She was too selfish intellectually. She didn’t even guess,
apparently, what his mood might be toward all this, loving
her as he did. No—she really didn’t care for him, or any
one else—couldn’t, or she couldn’t have done anything like
that. She would have lied to him rather. She had been,
and was—although now semi-reformed—a heartless, careless
wastrel, thinking of no one but herself. She had not
cared about the wives of either of those two men who were
pursuing her in B——, or what became of them, or
what became of any of the others who had pursued her
since. All she wanted was to be danced attendance on, to
be happy, free, never bored. The other fellow never
counted with Idelle much. In this case the wife of the
younger lover, Coulstone, had been informed, the conservatives
of the city appealed to, as it were. Coulstone, seeing
the storm and being infatuated with his conquest, suggested
Paris or a few years on the Riviera, but, strangely enough,
Idelle would have none of it, or him, then. She wouldn’t
agree to be tied down for so long! She had suffered a reversal
of conscience or mood—even—or so she said,—went
to a priest, went into retirement here in G——, having
fled her various evil pursuers.</p>



<p><em>How impressive the outlying slopes of these mountains
they were just entering!</em></p>



<p>And yet he could understand that, too, in some people,
anyhow,—the one decent thing in her life maybe, a timely
revolt against a too great and unbroken excess. But, alas,
it had been complicated with the fact that she wasn’t ready
to leave her mother or to do anything but stay in America.
Besides things were becoming rather complicated. The war
on J—— C—— threatened to expose her. Worse yet,—and
so like her, life had won her back. Her beauty, her disposition,
youth and age pursuing her—one slight concession
to indulgence or pleasure after another and the new mood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
or bent toward religiosity was entirely done away with.
Her sensual sex nature had conquered, of course.</p>



<p><em>That little cabin on that slope, showing a lone lamp in
the dark!</em></p>



<p>And then—then—</p>



<p><em>Morning, by George! Ten o’clock! He had been asleep
all this time! He would have to hurry and dress now!</em></p>



<p>But where was he in regard to Idelle? Oh yes!...
How she haunted him all the time these days! Coulstone,
angered at her refusal to come with him again (she could
not bring herself to do that, for all her religiosity, she said,
not caring for him so much any more), but frightened by
the presence of others, had eventually transferred all his
interests from Pittsburgh to G——, and at this very time,
on the ground of some form of virtue or duty—God only
knows what!—five years later, indeed—was here in G——
with his wife and attempting to persuade her that she ought
to give him a divorce in order to permit him to marry
Idelle and so legitimize her child! And he, Garrison,
already married to her! The insanity of mankind!</p>



<p><em>He must be hurrying through his breakfast; they would
soon be nearing G—— now ... and he must not forget
to stop in at Kiralfy’s when he reached G—— and buy some
flowers for her!</em></p>


<p>But Idelle was not to be taken that way. She did not
care for J—— C—— any more, or so she said. Besides
nothing would cure her varietism then or now but age,
apparently. And who was going to wait for age to overtake
her? Not he, anyhow. Why, the very event that threw
her into his arms—couldn’t he have judged by that if he
had had any sense? Wasn’t that just such another affair
as that of Coulstone and old Candia, only in this case it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
concerned much younger men—wasters in their way, too—one
of whom, at least, was plainly madly in love with her,
while the other was just intensely interested. Why was it
that Idelle’s affairs always had to be a complex of two or
more contending parties?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The condition of these washrooms in the morning!</em></p>
</div>

<p>According to her own story, she had first fallen in love,
or thought she had, with the younger of the two, Gaither
Browne, of the Harwood Brownes here in G—— and then
while he was still dancing attendance on her (and all the
while Coulstone was in the background, not entirely pushed
out of her life) young Gatchard Keene had come along
with his motor cars, his yacht, his stable of horses, and she
had begun to flirt with him also. Only, by then—and she
didn’t care particularly for him, either—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>What a crowded breakfast car—all the people of last
night, and more from other cars attached since, probably!</em></p>
</div>

<p>—she had half promised young Browne that she would
marry him, or let him think she might; had even confessed
a part of her past to him (or so she said) and he had forgiven
her, or said it didn’t matter. But when Keene came
along and she began to be interested in him Browne did not
like this new interest in the least, became furiously jealous
indeed. So great was his passion for her that he had threatened
to kill her and himself if she did not give up Keene,
which, according to her, made her care all the more for
Keene. When Browne could stand it no longer and was
fearful lest Keene was to capture the prize—which he was
not, of course, Idelle being a mere trifler at all stages—he
had invited her out on that disastrous automobile ride—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>A mere form, eating, this morning! No appetite—due
to his troubled thoughts, of course, these days!</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>—which had ended in her being carried into his presence
at the Insull General. Browne must have been vividly in
love with her to prefer to kill himself and her in that fashion
rather than lose her, for, according to her, he had swung
the car squarely into the rocks at Saltair Brook, only it
never came out in the papers, and neither Idelle nor Browne
would tell.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>All railway cars seemed so soiled toward the end of a
ride like this!</em></p>
</div>

<p>She professed afterwards to be sorry for Browne and inquired
after him every day, although, of course, she had
no sympathy for him or Keene, either,—for no man whom
she could engage in any such contest. She was too wholly
interested in following her own selfish bent. Afterward,
when Keene was calling daily and trying to find out how
it really did happen, and Coulstone was still in evidence
and worrying over her condition (and old Candia also, he
presumed—how could he tell whom all she had in tow at
that time?), she refused to tell them, or any of a half
dozen others who came to inquire. Yet right on top of all
that she had encouraged him, Garrison, to fall in love with
her, and had even imagined herself, or so she sneeringly
charged, whenever they quarreled, in love with him, ready
to reform and lead a better life, and had finally allowed
him to carry her off and marry her in the face of them all!
What were you to make of a creature like that? Insanity,
on his or her part? Or both? Both, of course.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Kenelm! They were certainly speeding on! Those four
wooden cows in that field, advertising a brand of butter!</em></p>
</div>

<p>But she could be so agreeable when she chose to be, and
was so fascinatingly, if irritatingly, beautiful all the time!</p>

<p>There was no doubt, though, that things were now reaching
such a state that there would have to be a change. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
couldn’t stand this any longer. Women like Idelle were
menaces, really, and shouldn’t be tolerated. Most men
wouldn’t stand for her, although he had. But why? Why?
Well, because he loved her, that was why, and you couldn’t
explain love. And the other reason—the worst of all—was
the dread he had been suffering of late years of being
left alone again if she left him. Alone! It was a terrible
feeling, this fear of being left alone in the future, and
especially when you were so drawn to some one who, whatever
her faults, could make you idyllically happy if she only
would. Lord, how peculiar these love passions of people
were, anyhow! How they swayed one! Tortured one!
Here he was haunted all the time now by the knowledge
that he would be miserable if she left him, and that he
needed some one like her to make him happy, a cheerful
and agreeable beauty when she chose to be, fascinating even
when she was not, and yet knowing that he would have to
learn to endure to be alone if ever he was to get the strength
to force her to better ways. Why couldn’t he? Or why
couldn’t she settle down and be decent once? Well, he
would have to face this out with her, once and for all now.
He wasn’t going to stand for her carrying on in this fashion.
She must sober down. She had had her way long enough
now, by God! He just wasn’t going to pose as her husband
and be a shield for her any longer! No sir, by George.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Only thirty-eight miles more! If she were not there now,
as she promised!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Beginning to-day she would have to give him a decent
deal or he would leave her. He wouldn’t—he couldn’t—stand
for it any longer. Think of that last time he had
come on from K——, just as he was coming to-day, and she
had agreed to be at home—because he had made her promise
before going that she would—and then, by George, when he
got off the train and walked into the Brandingham with
Arbuthnot to telephone, having just told Arbuthnot that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
expected to find her out at the house, wasn’t she there with
young Keene and four or five others, drinking and dancing?</p>

<p>“Why, there’s your wife now, Garrison,” Arbuthnot had
laughingly jested, and he had had to turn it all off with
that “Oh, yes, that’s right! I forgot! She was to meet
me here. How stupid of me!”</p>

<p>Why hadn’t he made a scene then? Why hadn’t he
broken things up then? Because he was a blank-blanked
fool, that’s why, allowing her to pull him around by the
nose and do as she pleased! Love, that’s why! He was a
damned fool for loving her as much as he did, and in the
face of all he knew!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Nearing Shively! Colonel Brandt’s stock-farm! Home
soon now! That little town in the distance, no connection
with the railroad at all!</em></p>
</div>

<p>On that particular occasion, when at last they were in
a taxi, she had begun one of her usual lies about having
come downtown for something—a romper for Tatty—only
when he ventured to show her what she was doing to herself
and him socially, that he was being made a fool of, and that
he really couldn’t stand it, hadn’t she flown into the usual
rage and exclaimed: “Oh, all right! Why don’t you leave
me then? I don’t care! I don’t care! I’m bored! I can’t
help it! I can’t always sit out in Sicard Avenue waiting
for you!”</p>

<p>In Sicard Avenue. And that on top of always refusing to
stay out there or to travel with him anywhere or to meet
him and go places! Think of that for a happy married life,
will you? Love! Love! Yes, love! Hell!</p>

<p>Well, here was Lawndale now, only eighteen miles—that
meant about eighteen minutes from here, the way they
were running now—and he would soon see her now if she
was at home. If she only were, just this one time, to kiss
him and laugh and ask about the trip and how he had
made out, and let him propose some quiet dinner somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
for just the two of them, a quiet dinner all to themselves,
and then home again! How delightful that would be!
Only— No doubt Charles would be at the station with the
jitney, as he always called the yellow racer. He would have
to summon all his ease to make his inquiry, for one had to
keep one’s face before the servants, you know—but then it
was entirely possible that Charles wouldn’t know whether
she was home or not. She didn’t always tell the servants.
If she wasn’t there, though—and after that letter and telegram—
Well—now—this time!—by God!—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Wheelwright! They were running a little later, perhaps,
but they would enter the station nearly on time!</em></p>
</div>

<p>But take, again, that last affair, that awful scene in the
Shackamaxon at C——, when without his knowing it she
had gone down there with Bodine and Arbuthnot and that
wretched Aikenhead. Think of being seen in a public place
like the Shackamaxon with Aikenhead and two such other
wasters (even if Mrs. Bodine were along—she was no
better than the others!), when she was already married and
under so much suspicion as it was. If it weren’t for him
she would have been driven out of society long ago! Of
course she would have! Hadn’t General and Mrs. de Pasy
cut her dead on that occasion?—only when they saw that
he had joined her they altered their expressions and were
polite enough, showing what they would do if they had to
deal with her alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>That brown automobile racing this train! How foolish
some automobilists were!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Well, that time, coming home and finding her away, he
had run down to C—— on the chance of finding her there—and
sure enough there she was dancing with Aikenhead
and Bodine by turns, and Mrs. Bodine and that free Mrs.
Gildas and Belle Geary joining them later. And when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
had sought her out to let her know he was back quite safe
and anxious to see her, hadn’t she turned on him with all
the fury of a wildcat—“Always following me up and snooping
around after me to catch me in something!” and that
almost loud enough for all the others to hear! It was
terrible! How could anybody stand for such a thing! He
couldn’t, and retain his self-respect. And yet he had—yes,
he had, more shame to him! But if it hadn’t been that
he had been so lonely just beforehand and so eager to see
her, and hadn’t had those earrings for her in his pocket—thinking
they would please her—perhaps he wouldn’t have
done as he did, backed down so. As it was—well, all he
could think of at the moment was to apologize—to his own
wife!—and plead that he hadn’t meant to seem to follow her
up and “snoop around.” Think of that! Hang it all,
why hadn’t he left her then and there? Supposing she
didn’t come back? Supposing she didn’t? What of it?
What of it? Only—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>This way out, please.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Well, here was G—— at last, and there was Charles,
well enough, waiting as usual. Would she be home now?
Would she? Perhaps, after all, he had better not say anything
yet, just go around to Kiralfy’s and get the flowers.
But to what end, really, if she weren’t there again? What
would he do this time? Surely this must be the end if she
weren’t there, if he had any strength at all. He wouldn’t
be put upon in this way again, would he?—after all he had
told himself he would do the last time if ever it happened
again! His own reputation was at stake now, really. It
depended on what he did now. What must the servants
think—his always following her up and she never being
there or troubling about him in the least?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Ah, Charles, there you are! To Kiralfy’s first, then
home!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>She was making him a laughing-stock, or would if he
didn’t take things in hand pretty soon to-day, really—a man
who hung onto a woman because she was young and pretty,
who tolerated a wife who did not care for him and who ran
with other men—a sickening, heartless social pack—in his
absence. She was pulling him down to her level, that’s
what she was doing, a level he had never deemed possible
in the old days. It was almost unbelievable—and yet— But
he would go in and get the flowers, anyway!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Back in a minute, Charles!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And now here was Sicard Avenue, again, dear old Sicard,
with its fine line of trees on either side of its broad roadway,
and their own big house set among elms and with
that French garden in front—so quiet and aristocratic!
Why couldn’t she be content with a place like this, with
her present place in society? Why not? Why not be
happy in it? She could be such an interesting social figure
if she chose, if she would only try. But no, no—she
wouldn’t. It would always be the same until—until—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The gardener had trimmed the grass again, and nicely!</em></p>
</div>

<p>“No, suh, Mr. Garrison,” George was already saying in
that sing-song darky way of his as he walked up the steps
ahead of him, and just as he expected or feared he would.
It was always the way, and always would be until he had
courage enough to leave once and for all—as he would
to-day, by George! He wouldn’t stand for this one moment
longer—not one. “Mrs. Garrison she say she done gone
to Mrs. Gildas’” (it might just as well have been the
Bodines, the Del Guardias or the Cranes—they were all
alike), “an’ dat yo’ was to call her up dere when yo’ come
in or come out. She say to say she lef’ a note fo’ yo’ on yo’
dresser.”</p>

<p>Curse her! Curse her! Curse her! To be treated like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
this all the time! He would fix her now, though, this time!
Yes, he would. This time he wouldn’t change his mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>And the brass on the front door not properly cleaned,
either!</em></p>
</div>

<p>“George,” this to his servant as the latter preceded him
into his room—their room—where he always so loved to
be when things were well between them, “never mind the
bags now. I’ll call you later when I want you,” and then,
as the door closed, almost glaring at everything about him.
There in the mirror, just above his military brushes, was
stuck a note—the usual wheedling, chaffering rot she was
inclined to write him when she wanted to be very nice on
such occasions as this. Now he would see what new lying,
fooling communication she had left for him, where he would
be asked to come now, what do, instead of her being here to
receive him as she had promised, as was her duty really, as
any decent married woman would—as any decent married
man would expect her to be. Oh, the devil!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>That fly buzzing in the window there, trying to get
out!</em></p>
</div>

<p>What was the use of being alive, anyway? What the
good of anything—money or anything else? He wouldn’t
stand for this any longer, he couldn’t—no, he couldn’t,
that was all there was to it! She could go to the devil
now; he wouldn’t follow her any more—never, never,
never!—the blank-blank-blank-blank——! This was the
end! This was the way she was always doing! But never
again now, not once more! He’d get a divorce now!
Now, by George, for once he would stand his ground and
be a man, not a social door-mat, a humble beggar of love,
hanging around hat in hand waiting for her favors! Never
again, by God! Never!! Never!!! Only—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>That letter of hers on the dresser there waiting for him,
as usual!</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dearest Old Judge: This isn’t the real one. This is
just a hundred-kiss one, this. The real one is pinned to your
pillow over there—our pillow—where it ought to be, don’t
you think? I don’t want you to be unhappy at not finding
me home, Judgie, see? And I don’t want you to get mad
and quarrel. And I do want you to be sure to find the
other letter. So don’t be angry, see? But call me up at
the Gildas’. I’m dying to see you, dearie, really and truly
I am! I’ve been so lonesome without you! (Yes!) You’re
sure to find me out there. And you’re not to be angry—not
one little frown, do you hear? I just couldn’t help it, dearest!
So read the other letter now!</p>

<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Idelle.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>If only his hands wouldn’t tremble so! Damn her! Damn
her! Damn her! To think she would always treat him like
this! To think he was never to have one decent hour of
her time to himself, not one! Always this running here,
there and everywhere away from him, as it were!</em></p>
</div>

<p>He crumpled up the note and threw it on the floor, then
went to the window and looked out. There over the way
at her own spacious door was young Mrs. Justus just entering
her car—a simple, home-loving little woman, who would
never dream of the treacheries and eccentricities of Idelle;
who, if she even guessed what manner of woman she was,
would never have anything more to do with her. Why
couldn’t he have loved a girl like her—why not? And
just beyond, the large quiet house of the Walterses, those
profoundly sober people of the very best ways and means,
always so kind and helpful, anxious to be sociable, of whom
Idelle could think of nothing better to say than “stuffy.”
Anything kind and gentle and orderly was just stuffy to
her, or dull. That was what she considered him, no doubt.
That’s because she was what she was, curses on her! She
couldn’t stand, or even understand, profoundly worthy
people like the Justuses or the Walterses. (There was
May Walters now at her dining-room window.) And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
then there were the Hartleys.... But that other note of
hers—what did it say? He ought to read that now, whether
he left or no; but he would leave this time, well enough!</p>

<p>He turned to the twin bed and from the fretted counterpane
unpinned the second lavender-colored and scented
note—the kind Idelle was always scribbling when she was
doing things she shouldn’t. It didn’t make one hanged bit
of difference now what she wrote, of course—only— He
wouldn’t follow her this time; no, he wouldn’t! He
wouldn’t have anything more to do with her ever! He
would quit now, lock the doors in a few minutes, discharge
the servants, cut off her allowance, tell her to go to blazes.
He would go and live at a club, as he had so often threatened
before to himself—or get out of G——, as he had also
threatened. He couldn’t stand the comment that would
follow, anyhow. He had had enough of it. He hated the
damned city! He had never had any luck in it. Never
had he been happy here, in spite of the fact that he had
been born and brought up here, and twice married here—never!
Twice now he had been treated like this by women
right here in this city, his home town, where everybody
knew! Twice he had been made a fool of, but this time—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The letter, though!</em></p>
</div>

<p>“Dearest and best of hubbies, I know you’re going to be
disappointed at not finding me here, and in spite of anything
I can say, probably terribly angry, too. (I wish you
wouldn’t be, darling!) But, sweetheart, if you’ll only believe
me this time (I’ve said that before when you wouldn’t,
I know, and it wasn’t my fault, either), it wasn’t premeditated,
really, it wasn’t! Honest, cross my heart, dear,
twenty ways, and hope to die!”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<em>What did she really care for his disappointment or what
he suffered, curse her!</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>“Only yesterday at four Betty called up and insisted that
I should come. There’s a big house party on, and you’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
invited, of course, when you get back. Her cousin Frank
is coming and some friends of his,”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(<em>Yes, he knew what friends!</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>“and four of my old girl chums, so I just couldn’t get out of
it, nor would I, particularly since she wanted me to help
her, and I’ve asked her so many times to help us—now,
could I?”</p>

<p>Idelle’s way in letters, as in person, was always bantering.
To the grave with Betty Gildas and all her house
parties, in so far as he was concerned, the fast, restless,
heartless thing! Why couldn’t she have been here just
this once, when he wanted her so much and had wired and
written in plenty of time for her to be!</p>

<p>But no, she didn’t care for him. She never had. She
merely wanted to fool him along like this, to keep his name,
his position, the social atmosphere he could give her. This
whole thing was a joke to her—this house, his friends, himself,
all—just nothing! Her idea was to fool him along in
this way while she continued to run with these other shabby,
swift, restless, insatiable creatures like herself, who liked
cabarets, thés dansants, automobile runs to this, that and
the other wretched place, country house parties, country
clubs, country this, country that, or New York and all its
shallow and heartless mockery of simplicity and peace.
Well, he was through. She was always weary of him,
never anxious to be with him for one moment even, but
never weary of any of them, you bet—of seeking the wildest
forms of pleasure! Well, this was the end now. He had
had enough. She could go her own way from now on.
Let the beastly flowers lie there—what did he care? He
wouldn’t carry them to her. He was through now. He
was going to do what he said—leave. Only—</p>

<p>He began putting some things in another bag, in addition
to the ones he had—his silk shirts, extra underwear, all
his collars. Once and for all now he wouldn’t stand this—never!
Never!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>Only—</p>

<p>As he fumed and glared, his eye fell on his favorite photo
of Idelle—young, rounded, sensuous, only twenty-four to his
forty-eight, an air and a manner flattering to any man’s
sense of vanity and possession—and then, as a contrast, he
thought of the hard, smiling, self-efficiency of so many of
her friends—J—— C——, for one, still dogging her heels
in spite of him, and Keene, young and wealthy, and Arbuthnot—and
who not else?—any one and all of whom would
be glad to take her if he left her. And she knew this. It
was a part of her strength, even her charm—curse her!
Curse her! Curse her!</p>

<p>But more than that, youth, youth, the eternal lure of
beauty and vitality, her smiling softness at times, her geniality,
her tolerance, their long talks and pleasant evenings and
afternoons. And all of these calling, calling now. And
yet they were all at the vanishing point, perhaps never to
come again, if he left her! She had warned him of that.
“If I go,” she had once said—more than once, indeed—“it’s
for good. Don’t think I’ll ever come back, for I won’t.”
And he understood well enough that she would not. She
didn’t care for him enough to come back. She never would,
if she really went.</p>

<p>He paused, meditating, biting his lips as usual, flushing,
frowning, darkening—a changeable sky his face—and then—</p>

<p>“George,” he said after the servant had appeared in
answer to his ring, “tell Charles to bring the jitney around
again, and you pack me the little brown kit bag out of these
others. I’m going away for a day or two, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh!”</p>

<p>Then down the stairs, saying that Idelle was a liar, a
wastrel, a heartless butterfly, worthy to be left as he proposed
to leave her now. Only, once outside in his car with
Charles at the wheel, and ready to take him wherever he
said, he paused again, and then—sadly— “To the
Gildases, and better go by the Skillytown road. It’s the
shortest!”</p>

<p>Then he fell to thinking again.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV">IV<br>
ST. COLUMBA AND THE RIVER</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> first morning that McGlathery saw the great
river stretching westward from the point where the
initial shaft had been sunk he was not impressed by it—or,
rather, he was, but not favorably. It looked too gray
and sullen, seeing that he was viewing it through a driving,
sleety rain. There were many ferry boats and craft of all
kinds, large and small, steaming across its choppy bosom,
giant steamers, and long projecting piers, great and mysterious,
and clouds of gulls, and the shriek of whistles, and
the clang of fog-bells,... but he did not like water. It
took him back to eleven wretched seasick days in which he
had crossed on the steamer from Ireland. But then, glory
be, once freed from the mysteries of Ellis Island, he had
marched out on dry land at the Battery, cloth bags in hand,
and exclaimed, “Thanks be, I’m shut av it!”</p>

<p>And he thought he was, for he was mortally afraid of
water. But fate, alas! had not decreed it as a permanent
thing. As a matter of fact, water in one form or another
had persistently seemed to pursue him since. In Ireland,
County Clare, from whence he hailed, he had been a
ditcher—something remotely connected with water. Here
in America, and once safely settled in Brooklyn, he had
no sooner sought work than the best he could seemingly
get was a job in connection with a marsh which was being
drained, a very boggy and pool-y one—water again, you
see. Then there was a conduit being dug, a great open
sewer which once when he and other members of the construction
gang were working on it, was flooded by a cloudburst,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
a tremendous afternoon rain-storm which drove them
from it with a volume of water which threatened to drown
them all. Still later, he and thirty others were engaged in
cleaning out a two-compartment reservoir, old and stone-rotten,
when, one-half being empty and the other full, the
old dividing wall broke, and once more he barely escaped
with his life by scrambling up a steep bank. It was then
that the thought first took root in his mind that water—any
kind of water, sea or fresh—was not favorable to him.
Yet here he was, facing this great river on a gray rainy
November morning, and with the avowed object of going
to work in the tunnel which was about to be dug under it.</p>

<p>Think of it! In spite of his prejudices and fears, here he
was, and all due to one Thomas Cavanaugh, a fellow
churchman and his foreman these last three years, who had
happened to take a fancy to him and had told him that if
he came to work in the tunnel and prosecuted his new work
thoroughly, and showed himself sufficiently industrious and
courageous, it might lead to higher things—viz., bricklaying,
or plastering, in the guise of cement moulding, down in
this very tunnel, or timbering, or better yet, the steel-plate-joining
trade, which was a branch of the ironworkers’ guild
and was rewarded by no less a compensation than twelve
dollars a day. Think of it—twelve dollars a day! Men
of this class and skill were scarce in tunnel work and in
great demand in America. This same Cavanaugh was
to be one of the foremen in this tunnel, his foreman, and
would look after him. Of course it required time and
patience. One had to begin at the bottom—the same being
seventy-five feet under the Hudson River, where some very
careful preliminary digging had to be done. McGlathery
had surveyed his superior and benefactor at the time with
uncertain and yet ambitious eyes.</p>

<p>“Is it as ye tell me now?” he commented at one place.</p>

<p>“Yis. Av course. What d’ye think I’m taalkin’ to ye
about?”</p>

<p>“Ye say, do ye?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Well! Well! Belike it’s a fine job. I dunno. Five
dollars a day, ye say, to begin with?”</p>

<p>“Yis, five a day.”</p>

<p>“Well, a man in my line could git no more than that,
eh? It wouldn’t hurt me fer once, fer a little while anyway,
hey?”</p>

<p>“It would be the makin’ av ye.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be with ye. Yis, I’ll be with ye. It’s not
five I can git everywhere. When is it ye’ll be wantin’ me?”</p>

<p>The foreman, a Gargantuan figure in yellow jeans and
high rubber boots smeared to the buttocks with mud, eyed
him genially and amiably, the while McGlathery surveyed
his superior with a kind of reverence and awe, a reverence
which he scarcely felt for any other man, unless perchance
it might be his parish priest, for he was a good Catholic,
or the political backer of his district, through whom he
had secured his job. What great men they all were, to be
sure, leading figures in his life.</p>

<p>So here he was on this particular morning shortly after
the work had been begun, and here was the river, and down
below in this new shaft, somewhere, was Thomas Cavanaugh,
to whom he had to report before he could go to
work.</p>

<p>“Sure, it’s no colleen’s job,” he observed to a fellow
worker who had arrived at the mouth of the shaft about the
same time as himself, and was beginning to let himself
down the ladder which sank darkly to an intermediate
platform, below which again was another ladder and platform,
and below that a yellow light. “Ye say Mr. Cavanaugh
is below there?”</p>

<p>“He is,” replied the stranger without looking up. “Ye’ll
find him inside the second lock. Arr ye workin’ here?”</p>

<p>“Yis.”</p>

<p>“Come along, then.”</p>

<p>With a bundle which consisted of his rubber boots, a
worn suit of overalls, and with his pick and shovel over his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
shoulder, he followed. He reached the bottom of the pit,
boarded as to the sides with huge oak planks sustained by
cross beams, and there, with several others who were waiting
until the air pressure should be adjusted, entered the
lock. The comparatively small and yet massive chamber,
with its heavy iron door at either end, responding so slowly
to pressure, impressed him. There was only a flickering
light made by a gasoline torch here. There was a whistling
sound from somewhere.</p>

<p>“Ever work under air pressure before, Paddy?” inquired
a great hulking ironworker, surveying him with a genial
leer.</p>

<p>“Air what?” asked McGlathery without the slightest
comprehension of what was meant, but not to be outdone
by mere words. “No, I never did.”</p>

<p>“Well, ye’re under it now, two thousand pounds to the
square inch. Don’t ye feel it?”</p>

<p>Dennis, who had been feeling an odd sensation about his
ear-drums and throat, but had no knowledge that it was
related to this, acknowledged that he did. “’Tis air, is
it?” he inquired. “’Tis a quare feeling I have.” The
hissing ceased.</p>

<p>“Yuh want to look out fer that, new man,” volunteered
another, a skimpy, slithery, genial American. “Don’t let
’em rush that stuff on yuh too fast. Yuh may git the
‘bends.’”</p>

<p>Dennis, ignorant as to the meaning of “bends,” made no
reply.</p>

<p>“D’yuh know what the ‘bends’ is, new man?” persisted
the other provocatively.</p>

<p>“Naw,” replied Dennis awkwardly after a time, feeling
himself the centre of a fire of curious observations and solicitation.</p>

<p>“Well, yuh will if yuh ever git ’em—haw! haw!” this
from a waggish lout, a bricklayer who had previously not
spoken. The group in the lock was large. “It comes
from them lettin’ the pressure be put on or took off too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
fast. It twists yer muscles all up, an’ does sumpin’ to yer
nerves. Yuh’ll know it if yuh ever git it.”</p>

<p>“Member Eddie Slawder?” called another gaily. “He
died of it over here in Bellevue, after they started the Fourteenth
Street end. Gee, yuh oughta heerd him holler! I
went over to see him.”</p>

<p>Good news, indeed! So this was his introduction to the
tunnel, and here was a danger not commented on by Cavanaugh.
In his dull way McGlathery was moved by it.
Well, he was here now, and they were forcing open the
door at the opposite side of the lock, and the air pressure
had not hurt him, and he was not killed yet; and then, after
traversing a rather neatly walled section of tunnel, albeit
badly littered with beams and plates and bags of cement
and piles of brick, and entering another lock like the first
and coming out on the other side—there, amid an intricate
network of beams and braces and a flare of a half dozen
great gasoline lamps which whistled noisily, and an overhanging
mass of blackness which was nothing less than earth
under the great river above, was Cavanaugh, clad in a short
red sweater and great rubber boots, an old yellowish-brown
felt hat pulled jauntily over one ear. He was conversing
with two other foremen and an individual in good clothes,
one of those mighties—an engineer, no doubt.</p>

<p>Ah, how remote to McGlathery were the gentlemen in
smooth fitting suits! He viewed them as you might creatures
from another realm.</p>

<p>Beyond this lock also was a group of night workers left
over from the night before and under a strange foreman
(ditchers, joiners, earth carriers, and steel-plate riveters), all
engaged in the rough and yet delicate risk of forcing and
safeguarding a passage under the river, and only now leaving.
The place was full. It was stuffy from the heat of
the lamps, and dirty from the smear of the black muck
which was over everything. Cavanaugh spied Dennis as
he made his way forward over the widely separated beams.</p>

<p>“So here ye arr! These men are just after comin’ out,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and he waved a hand toward the forward end of the tunnel.
“Git in there, Dennis, and dig out that corner beyond the
post there. Jerry here’ll help ye. Git the mud up on this
platform so we can git these j’ists in here.”</p>

<p>McGlathery obeyed. Under the earthy roof whose surface
he could see but dimly at the extreme forward end of
the tunnel beyond that wooden framework, he took his position.
With a sturdy arm and a sturdy back and a sturdy
foot and leg, he pushed his spade into the thick mud, or
loosened it with his pick when necessary, and threw it up
on the crude platform, where other men shoveled it into a
small car which was then trundled back over the rough
boards to the lock, and so on out. It was slow, dirty, but
not difficult work, so long as one did not think of the heavy
river overhead with its ships and its choppy waves in the
rain, and the gulls and the bells. Somehow, Dennis was
fearfully disturbed as to the weight of this heavy volume of
earth and water overhead. It really terrified him. Perhaps
he had been overpersuaded by the lure of gold? Suppose
it should break through, suppose the earth over his
head should suddenly drop and bury him—that dim black
earth overhead, as heavy and thick as this he was cutting
with his shovel now.</p>

<p>“Come, Dennis, don’t be standin’ there lookin’ at the roof.
The roof’s not goin’ to hurt ye. Ye’re not down here to be
lookin’ after the roof. I’ll be doin’ that. Just ye ‘tend to
yer shovelin’.”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Cavanaugh near at hand. Unconsciously
McGlathery had stopped and was staring upward.
A small piece of earth had fallen and struck him on the
back. Suppose! Suppose!</p>

<p>Know, O reader, that the business of tunneling is one of
the most hazardous and dramatic, albeit interesting, of all
known fields of labor. It consists, in these latter days at least,
in so far as under-water tunneling is concerned, of sinking
huge shafts at either end or side of a river, lake or channel
(one hundred feet, perhaps, within the shore line) to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
depth of, say, thirty feet below the water level, and from
these two points tunneling outward under the bottom of the
river until the two ends meet somewhere near the middle.
The exact contact and precise joining of these outer ends
is considered one of the true tests of skilful engineering.
McGlathery personally understood all this but dimly. And
even so it could not cheer him any.</p>

<p>And it should be said here that the safety of the men
who did the work, and the possibility of it, depended first
on the introduction at either end, just at the base of the
shafts and then at about every hundred or so feet, as the
tunnel progressed outward, of huge cylindrical chambers,
or locks, of heavy iron—air locks, no less—fifteen feet in
diameter, and closed at each end by massive doors swinging
inward toward the shore line, so that the amazing and
powerful pressure of air constantly forced outward from
the shore by huge engines could not force them open. It
was only by the same delicate system which causes water
locks to open and close that they could be opened at all.
That is, workingmen coming down into the shaft and desiring
to pass into the head of the tunnel beyond the lock,
would have to first enter one of these locks, which would
then gradually be filled with air compressed up to the same
pressure as that maintained in the main portion of the tunnel
farther in. When this pressure had been reached they
could easily open the inward swinging door and pass into
the tunnel proper. Here, provided that so much had been
completed, they might walk, say, so much as a hundred or
more feet, when they would encounter another lock. The
pressure in the lock, according to who had last used it,
would be either that of the section of the tunnel toward the
shore, or of the section beyond, toward the centre of the
river. At first, bell cords, later telephones, and then
electric signals controlled this—that is, the lowering or
raising of the pressure of air in the locks so that one door
or the other might be opened. If the pressure in the lock
was different from that in your section, and you could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
open the door (which you could not), you pulled the cord
or pushed the button so many times, according to your position,
and the air in the lock was adjusted to the section of
the tunnel in which you stood. Then you could open the
door. Once in, as in a water lock, the air was raised or
lowered, according to your signal, and you could enter the
next section outward or inward. All these things had been
adjusted to a nicety even in those days, which was years
ago.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The digging of this particular tunnel seemed safe enough—for
McGlathery at least, once he began working here. It
moved at the rate of two and even three feet a day, when
things were going well, only there were days and days when,
owing to the need of shoring and timbering and plate setting,
to say nothing of the accidental encountering of rock in front
which had to be drilled away, the men with picks and shovels
had to be given a rest, or better yet, set to helping the joiners
in erecting those cross beams and supports which made the
walls safe. It was so that Dennis learned much about joining
and even drilling.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the increased pay, this matter
of working under the river was a constant source of fear to
him. The earth in which he worked was so uncertain. One
day it would be hard black mud, another soft, another silt,
another sand, according as the tunnel sloped further and
further under the bed. In addition, at times great masses of
it fell, not enough to make a hole in the roof above, but
enough, had it chanced to fall on one of the workers, to
break his back or half bury him in mud. Usually it was
broken by the beams overhead. Only one day, some seven
months after he had begun and when he was becoming
fairly accustomed to the idea of working here, and when
his skill had increased to such an extent that he was considered
one of the most competent workers in his limited
field, the unexpected happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>He had come down one morning at eight with the rest of
his gang and was working about the base of two new supports
which had just been put in place, when he noticed, or
thought he did, that the earth seemed wetter than usual,
sticky, watery, and hard to manage. It could not have been
much worse had a subterranean spring been encountered.
Besides, one of the gasoline lamps having been brought forward
and hung close by, he noticed by its light that the
ceiling seemed to look silvery gray and beady. He spoke
of it to Cavanaugh, who stood by.</p>

<p>“Yis,” said his foreman dubiously, staring upward, “’tis
wet. Maybe the air pumps is not workin’ right. I’ll just
make sure,” and he sent word to the engineer.</p>

<p>The shaft superintendent himself appeared.</p>

<p>“Everything’s all right up above,” he said. “Two thousand
pounds to the square inch. I’ll just put on a little
more, if you say so.”</p>

<p>“Ye’d better,” replied Cavanaugh. “The roof’s not actin’
right. And if ye see Mr. Henderson, send him down. I’d
like to talk to him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” and off he went.</p>

<p>McGlathery and the others, at first nervous, but now
slightly reassured, worked on. But the ground under their
feet became sloppy, and some of the silvery frosting on the
roof began to drop and even trickle as water. Then a mass
of sloppy mud fell.</p>

<p>“Back, men!”</p>

<p>It was the voice of Cavanaugh, but not quicker than the
scampering of the men who, always keenly alive to the
danger of a situation, had taken note of the dripping water
and the first flop of earth. At the same time, an ominous
creak from one of the beams overhead gave warning of the
imminence of a catastrophe. A pell-mell rush for the
lock some sixty feet away ensued. Tools were dropped,
precedence disregarded. They fell and stumbled over the
beams and between, pushing each other out of the way into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
the water and mud as they ran, McGlathery a fair second
to none.</p>

<p>“Open the door! Open the door!” was the cry as they
reached the lock, for some one had just entered from the
other side—the engineer. “For Christ’s sake, open the
door!” But that could not be done so quickly. A few moments
at least had to elapse.</p>

<p>“It’s breakin’ in!” cried some one in a panicky voice, an
ironworker.</p>

<p>“Great God, it’s comin down!” this from one of the
masons, as three lamps in the distance were put out by the
mud.</p>

<p>McGlathery was almost dying of fear. He was sweating
a cold sweat. Five dollars a day indeed! He should
stay away from water, once and for all. Didn’t he know
that? It was always bad luck to him.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble? What’s the trouble?” called the
amazed engineer as, unconscious of what was happening
outside, he pushed open the door.</p>

<p>“Git out of the way!”</p>

<p>“Fer God’s sake, let us in!”</p>

<p>“Shut the door!” this from a half dozen who had already
reached safety assuming that the door could be instantly
closed.</p>

<p>“Wait! Cavanaugh’s outside!” This from some one—not
McGlathery, you may be sure, who was cowering in a
corner. He was so fearful that he was entirely unconscious
of his superior’s fate.</p>

<p>“To hell with Cavanaugh! Shut the door!” screamed
another, a great ironworker, savage with fear.</p>

<p>“Let Cavanaugh in, I say!” this from the engineer.</p>

<p>At this point McGlathery, for the first time on this or
any other job, awoke to a sense of duty, but not much at
that. He was too fearful. This was what he got for coming
down here at all. He knew Cavanaugh—Cavanaugh
was his friend, indeed. Had he not secured him this and
other jobs? Surely. But then Cavanaugh had persuaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
him to come down here, which was wrong. He ought not
to have done it. Still, even in his fear he had manhood
enough to feel that it was not quite right to shut Cavanaugh
out. Still, what could he do—he was but one. But even as
he thought, and others were springing forward to shut
Cavanaugh out, so eager were they to save themselves, they
faced a gleaming revolver in the steady hand of the big
foreman.</p>

<p>“I’ll shoot down the first damned man that tries to shut
the door before me and Kelly are in,” the big foreman was
calling, the while he was pulling this same Kelly from the
mud and slime outside. Then fairly throwing him into the
lock, and leaping after him, he turned and quietly helped
closed the door.</p>

<p>McGlathery was amazed at this show of courage. To
stop and help another man like that in the face of so much
danger! Cavanaugh was even a better and kinder man
than he had thought—really a great man—no coward like
himself. But why had Cavanaugh persuaded him to come
down here when he knew that he was afraid of water! And
now this had happened. Inside as they cowered—all but
Cavanaugh—they could hear the sound of crushing timber
and grinding brick outside, which made it quite plain that
where a few moments before had been beams and steel and
a prospective passageway for men, was now darkness and
water and the might of the river, as it had been since the
beginning.</p>

<p>McGlathery, seeing this, awoke to the conviction that in
the first place he was a great coward, and in the second that
the tunnel digging was no job for him. He was by no means
fitted for it, he told himself. “’Tis the last,” he commented,
as he climbed safely out with the others after a distressing
wait of ten minutes at the inward lock. “Begob, I thought
we was all lost. ’Twas a close shave. But I’ll go no more
below. I’ve had enough.” He was thinking of a small
bank account—six hundred dollars in all—which he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
saved, and of a girl in Brooklyn who was about to marry
him. “No more!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But, at that, as it stood, there was no immediate danger
of work being offered. The cave-in had cost the contractors
thousands and in addition had taught them that mere air
pressure and bracing as heretofore followed were not sufficient
for successful tunneling. Some new system would
have to be devised. Work on both halves of the tunnel
was suspended for over a year and a half, during which
time McGlathery married, a baby was born to him, and
his six hundred had long since diminished to nothing. The
difference between two and five dollars a day is considerable.
Incidentally, he had not gone near his old foreman in
all this time, being somehow ashamed of himself, and in
consequence he had not fared so well. Previously Cavanaugh
had kept him almost constantly employed, finding
him faithful and hard-working, but now owing to stranger
associates there were weeks when he had no work at all and
others when he had to work for as little as one-fifty a day.
It was not so pleasant. Besides, he had a sneaking feeling
that if he had behaved a little more courageously at that
time, gone and talked to his old foreman afterward or at the
time, he might now be working for good pay. Alas, he had
not done so, and if he went now Cavanaugh would be sure
to want to know why he had disappeared so utterly. Then,
in spite of his marital happiness, poverty began to press him
so. A second and a third child were born—only they were
twins.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Henderson, the engineer whom Cavanaugh
had wanted to consult with at the time, had devised
a new system of tunneling, namely, what subsequently came
to be known as the pilot tunnel. This was an iron tube ten
feet in length and fifteen feet in diameter—the width of the
tunnel, which was carried forward on a line with the axis of
the tunnel into the ground ahead. When it was driven in far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
enough to be completely concealed by the earth about, then
the earth within was removed. The space so cleared was then
used exactly as a hub is used on a wagon wheel. Beams like
spokes were radiated from its sides to its centre, and the surrounding
earth sustained by heavy iron plates. On this
plan the old company had decided to undertake the work
again.</p>

<p>One evening, sitting in his doorway thumbing his way
through an evening paper which he could barely read, McGlathery
had made all this out. Mr. Henderson was to be
in charge as before. Incidentally it was stated that Thomas
Cavanaugh was going to return as one of the two chief foremen.
Work was to be started at once. In spite of himself,
McGlathery was impressed. If Cavanaugh would only take
him back! To be sure, he had come very near losing his
life, as he thought, but then he had not. No one had, not a
soul. Why should <em>he</em> be so fearful if Cavanaugh could take
such chances as he had? Where else could he make five
dollars a day? Still, there was this haunting sensation that
the sea and all of its arms and branches, wherever situated,
were inimical to him and that one day one of them would
surely do him a great injury—kill him, perhaps. He had a
recurring sensation of being drawn up into water or down,
he could not tell which, and of being submerged in ooze and
choking slowly. It was horrible.</p>

<p>But five dollars a day as against one-fifty or two or none
at all (seven, once he became very proficient) and an assured
future as a tunnel worker, a “sand-hog,” as he had
now learned such men as himself were called, was a luring
as well as a disturbing thought. After all, he had no trade
other than this he had begun to learn under Cavanaugh.
Worse he was not a union man, and the money he had once
saved was gone, and he had a wife and three children. With
the former he had various and sundry talks. To be sure,
tunneling was dangerous, but still! She agreed with him
that he had better not, but—after all, the difference that five,
maybe seven, instead of two a day would make in their living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
expenses was in both their minds. McGlathery saw it.
He decided after a long period of hesitation that perhaps he
had best return. After all, nothing had happened to him
that other time, and might it ever again, really? He meditated.</p>

<p>As has been indicated, a prominent element in McGlathery’s
nature was superstition. While he believed in the
inimical nature of water to him, he also believed in the
power of various saints, male and female, to help or hinder.
In the Catholic Church of St. Columba of South Brooklyn,
at which McGlathery and his young wife were faithful attendants,
there was a plaster statue of a saint of this same
name, a co-worker with St. Patrick in Ireland, it appears,
who in McGlathery’s native town of Kilrush, County of
Clare, on the water’s edge of Shannon, had been worshipped
for centuries past, or at least highly esteemed, as having
some merit in protecting people at sea, or in adventures
connected with water. This was due, perhaps, to the fact
that Kilrush was directly on the water and had to have a
saint of that kind. At any rate, among other things, he
had occasionally been implored for protection in that realm
when McGlathery was a boy. On his setting out for
America, for instance, some few years before at the suggestion
of his mother, he had made a novena before this
very saint, craving of him a safe conduct in crossing the
sea, as well as prosperity once he had arrived in America.
Well, he had crossed in safety, and prospered well enough,
he thought. At least he had not been killed in any tunnel.
In consequence, on bended knees, two blessed candles burning
before him in the rack, a half dollar deposited in the
box labeled “St. Columba’s Orphans,” he finally asked of
this saint whether, in case he returned to this underground
tunnel work, seeing that necessity was driving him, would
he be so kind as to protect him? He felt sure that Cavanaugh,
once he applied to him, and seeing that he had
been a favorite worker, would not begrudge him a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
if he had one. In fact he knew that Cavanaugh had always
favored him as a good useful helper.</p>

<p>After seven “Our Fathers” and seven “Hail Marys,”
said on his knees, and a litany of the Blessed Virgin for
good measure, he crossed himself and arose greatly refreshed.
There was a pleasant conviction in his mind now, newly
come there before this image, that he would never come to
real harm by any power of water. It was a revelation—a
direct communication, perhaps. At any rate, something told
him to go and see Cavanaugh at once, before the work was
well under way, and not be afraid, as no harm would come
to him, and besides, he might not get anything even though
he desired it so much if he delayed. He bustled out of the
church and over to the waterfront where the deserted shaft
was still standing, and sure enough, there was Cavanaugh,
conversing with Mr. Henderson.</p>

<p>“Yis—an’ what arr ye here fer?” he now demanded to
know of McGlathery rather amusedly, for he had sensed the
cause of his desertion.</p>

<p>“I was readin’ that ye was about to start work on the
tunnel again.”</p>

<p>“An’ so we arr. What av it?”</p>

<p>“I was thinkin’ maybe ye’d have a place fer me. I’m
married now an’ have three children.”</p>

<p>“An’ ye’re thinkin’ that’s a reason fer givin’ ye something,
is it?” demanded the big foreman rather cynically,
with a trace of amusement. “I thought ye said ye was shut
av the sea—that ye was through now, once an’ fer all?”</p>

<p>“So I did, but I’ve changed me mind. It’s needin’ the
work I am.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Cavanaugh. “We’re beginnin’
in the mornin’. See that ye’re here at seven sharp. An’
mind ye, no worryin’ or lookin’ around. We’ve a safe way
now. It’s different. There’s no danger.”</p>

<p>McGlathery gratefully eyed his old superior, then departed,
only to return the next morning a little dubious
but willing. St. Columba had certainly indicated that all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
would be well with him—but still— A man is entitled
to a few doubts even when under the protection of the best
of saints. He went down with the rest of the men and
began cleaning out that nearest section of the tunnel where
first water and then earth had finally oozed and caked.
That done he helped install the new pilot tunnel which was
obviously a great improvement over the old system. It
seemed decidedly safe. McGlathery attempted to explain
its merits to his wife, who was greatly concerned for him,
and incidentally each morning and evening on his way to
and from his task he dropped in at St. Columba’s to offer
up a short silent prayer. In spite of his novena and understanding
with the saint he was still suspicious of this dread
river above him, and of what might happen to him in spite
of St. Columba. The good saint, due to some error on the
part of McGlathery, might change his mind.</p>

<p>Nothing happened, of course, for days and weeks and
months. Under Cavanaugh’s direction the work progressed
swiftly, and McGlathery and he, in due time, became once
more good friends, and the former an expert bracer or timberer,
one of the best, and worth seven a day really, which
he did not get. Incidentally, they were all shifted from day
to night work, which somehow was considered more important.
There were long conversations now and again
between Cavanaugh and Henderson, and Cavanaugh and
other officials of the company who came down to see, which
enlightened McGlathery considerably as to the nature and
danger of the work. Just the same, overhead was still
the heavy river—he could feel it pushing at him at times,
pushing at the thick layer of mud and silt above him and
below which with the aid of this new pilot shield they were
burrowing.</p>

<p>Yet nothing happened for months and months. They
cleared a thousand feet without a hitch. McGlathery
began to feel rather comfortable about it all. It certainly
seemed reasonably safe under the new system. Every night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
he went down and every morning came up, as hale and
healthy as ever, and every second week, on a Tuesday, a
pay envelope containing the handsome sum of seventy-two
dollars was handed him. Think of it! Seventy-two dollars!
Naturally, as a token of gratitude to St. Columba,
he contributed liberally to his Orphans’ Home, a dollar
a month, say, lit a fresh candle before his shrine every
Sunday morning after high mass, and bought two lots out
on the Goose Creek waterfront—on time—on which some
day, God willing, he proposed to build a model summer
and winter cottage. And then—! Well, perhaps, as he
thought afterward, it might have been due to the fact that
his prosperity had made him a little more lax than he should
have been, or proud, or not quite as thoughtful of the saint
as was his due. At any rate, one night, in spite of St.
Columba—or could it have been with his aid and consent
in order to show McGlathery his power?—the wretched
sneaky river did him another bad turn, a terrible turn,
really.</p>

<p>It was this way. While they were working at midnight
under the new form of bracing, based on the pilot tunnel,
and with an air pressure of two thousand pounds to the
square inch which had so far sufficed to support the iron
roof plates which were being put in place behind the pilot
tunnel day after day, as fast as space permitted, and with
the concrete men following to put in a form of arch which
no river weight could break, the very worst happened.
For it was just at this point where the iron roof and the
mud of the river bottom came in contact behind the pilot
tunnel that there was a danger spot ever since the new
work began. Cavanaugh had always been hovering about
that, watching it, urging others to be careful—“taking no
chances with it,” as he said.</p>

<p>“Don’t be long, men!” was his constant urge. “Up with
it now! Up with it! In with the bolts! Quick, now,
with yer riveter—quick! quick!”</p>

<p>And the men! How they worked there under the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
whenever there was sufficient space to allow a new steel
band to be segmentally set! For at that point it was, of
course, that the river might break through. How they
tugged, sweated, grunted, cursed, in this dark muddy hole,
lit by a few glittering electric arcs—the latest thing in
tunnel work! Stripped to the waist, in mud-soaked trousers
and boots, their arms and backs and breasts mud-smeared
and wet, their hair tousled, their eyes bleary—an artist’s
dream of bedlam, a heavenly inferno of toil—so they labored.
And overhead was the great river, Atlantic liners
resting upon it, thirty or fifteen or ten feet of soil only,
sometimes, between them and this thin strip of mud sustained,
supposedly, by two thousand pounds of air pressure
to the square inch—all they had to keep the river from
bleeding water down on them and drowning them like rats!</p>

<p>“Up with it! Up with it! Up with it! Now the bolts!
Now the riveter! That’s it! In with it, Johnny! Once
more now!”</p>

<p>Cavanaugh’s voice urging them so was like music to them,
their gift of energy, their labor song, their power to do, their
Ei Uchnam.</p>

<p>But there were times also, hours really, when the slow
forward movement of the pilot tunnel, encountering difficult
earth before it, left this small danger section unduly exposed
to the rotary action of the water overhead which was
constantly operating in the bed of the river. Leaks had
been discovered from time to time, small tricklings and
droppings of earth, which brought Cavanaugh and Henderson
to the spot and caused the greatest tension until they
had been done away with. The air had a tendency to bore
holes upward through the mud. But these were invariably
stanched with clay, or, if growing serious, bags of shavings
or waste, the air pressure blowing outward from below
being sufficient to hold these in place, provided the
breach was not too wide. Even when “all hands” were
working directly under a segment wide enough for a ring
of plates, one man was told off to “kape an eye on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>On the evening in question, however, after twenty-eight
men, including Cavanaugh and McGlathery, had entered
at six and worked until midnight, pushing the work as
vigorously as usual, seven of the men (they were told off
in lots of seven to do this) were allowed to go up to the
mouth of the tunnel to a nearby all-night saloon for a drink
and a bite of food. A half hour to each lot was allowed,
when another group would depart. There was always a
disturbing transition period every half hour between twelve
and two, during which one group was going and another
coming, which resulted at times in a dangerous indifference
which Cavanaugh had come to expect at just about this time
and in consequence he was usually watching for it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, John Dowd, ditcher, told off to
keep an eye on the breach at this time, was replaced on this
particular night by Patrick Murtha, fresh from the corner
saloon, a glass of beer and the free lunch counter still in
his mind. He was supposed to watch closely, but having
had four glasses in rapid succession and meditating on their
excellence as well as that of the hot frankfurters, the while
he was jesting with the men who were making ready to
leave, he forgot about it. What now—was a man always
to keep his eye on the blanked thing! What was going to
happen anyway? What could happen? Nothing, of course.
What had ever happened in the last eight months?</p>

<p>“Sssst!”</p>

<p>What was that? A sound like the blowing off of steam.
All at once Cavanaugh, who was just outside the pilot tunnel
indicating to McGlathery and another just where certain
braces were to be put, in order that the pilot tunnel
might be pushed forward a few inches for the purpose of
inserting a new ring of plates, heard it. At a bound he was
back through the pilot hub, his face aflame with fear and
rage. Who had neglected the narrow breach?</p>

<p>“Come now! What the hell is this?” he was about to
exclaim, but seeing a wide breach suddenly open and water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
pour down in a swift volume, his spirit sank and fear overcame
him.</p>

<p>“Back, men! Stop the leak!”</p>

<p>It was the cry of a frightened and yet courageous man
at bay. There was not only fear, but disappointment, in it.
He had certainly hoped to obviate anything like this this
time. But where a moment before had been a hole that
might have been stopped with a bag of sawdust (and
Patrick Murtha was there attempting to do it) was now
a rapidly widening gap through which was pouring a small
niagara of foul river water, ooze and slime. As Cavanaugh
reached it and seized a bag to stay it, another mass of muddy
earth fell, striking both him and Murtha, and half blinding
them both. Murtha scrambled away for his life. McGlathery,
who had been out in the front of the fatal tunnel
with others, now came staggering back horribly frightened,
scarcely knowing what to do.</p>

<p>“Quick, Dennis! Into the lock!” Cavanaugh called to
him, while he himself held his ground. “Hurry!” and
realizing the hopelessness of it and his own danger, Dennis
thought to run past, but was stopped by the downpour of
water and mud.</p>

<p>“Quick! Quick! Into the lock! For Christ’s sake,
can’t ye see what’s happenin’? Through with ye!”</p>

<p>McGlathery, hesitating by his chief’s side, fearful to
move lest he be killed, uncertain this time whether to leave
his chief or not, was seized by Cavanaugh and literally
thrown through, as were others after him, the blinding ooze
and water choking them, but placing them within range of
safety. When the last man was through Cavanaugh himself
plunged after, wading knee-deep in mud and
water.</p>

<p>“Quick! Quick! Into the lock!” he called, and then seeing
McGlathery, who was now near it but waiting for him,
added, “In, in!” There was a mad scramble about the
door, floating timbers and bags interfering with many,
and then, just as it seemed as if all would reach safety, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
iron roof plate overhead, loosened by the breaking of plates
beyond, gave way, felling one man in the half-open doorway
of the lock and blocking and pinning it in such a way
that it could be neither opened nor closed. Cavanaugh and
others who came up after were shut out. McGlathery,
who had just entered and saw it, could do nothing. But
in this emergency, and unlike his previous attitude, he
and several others on the inside seized upon the dead man
and tried to draw him in, at the same time calling to
Cavanaugh to know what to do. The latter, dumbfounded,
was helpless. He saw very clearly and sadly that
very little if anything could be done. The plate across
the dead man was too heavy, and besides, the ooze was
already pouring over him into the lock. At the same time
the men in the lock, conscious that although they were
partially on the road to safety they were still in danger of
losing their lives, were frantic with fear.</p>

<p>Actually there were animal roars of terror. At the same
time McGlathery, once more realizing that his Nemesis,
water, had overtaken him and was likely to slay him at last,
was completely paralyzed with fear. St. Columba had
promised him, to be sure, but was not this that same vision
that he had had in his dreams, that awful sense of encroaching
ooze and mud? Was he not now to die this way, after
all? Was not his patron saint truly deserting him? It
certainly appeared so.</p>

<p>“Holy Mary! Holy St. Columba!” he began to pray,
“what shall I do now? Mother of God! Our Father, who
art in Heaven! Bejasus, it’s a tight place I’m in now!
I’ll never get out of this! Tower of Ivory! House of
Gold! Can’t we git him in, boys? Ark of the Covenant!
Gate of Heaven!”</p>

<p>As he gibbered and chattered, the others screaming about
him, some pulling at the dead man, others pulling at the
other door, the still eye of Cavanaugh outside the lock
waist-deep in mud and water was surveying it all.</p>

<p>“Listen to me, men!” came his voice in rich, heavy, guttural<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
tones. “You, McGlathery! Dennis!! Arr ye all
crazy! Take aaf yer clothes and stop up the doorway!
It’s yer only chance! Aaf with yer clothes, quick! And
those planks there—stand them up! Never mind us. Save
yerselves first. Maybe ye can do something for us afterwards.”</p>

<p>As he argued, if only the gap in the door could be closed
and the compressed air pushing from the tunnel outward
toward the river allowed to fill the chamber, it would be
possible to open the other door which gave into the next
section shoreward, and so they could all run to safety.</p>

<p>His voice, commanding, never quavering, even in the face
of death, subsided. About and behind him were a dozen
men huddled like sheep, waist-deep in mud and water, praying
and crying. They had got as close to him as might
be, still trying to draw upon the sustaining force of his
courage, but moaning and praying just the same and looking
at the lock.</p>

<p>“Yis! Yis!” exclaimed McGlathery of a sudden,
awakening at last to a sense of duty and that something
better in conduct and thought which he had repeatedly
promised himself and his saint that he would achieve. He
had been forgetting. But now it seemed to him once more
that he had been guilty of that same great wrong to his
foreman which had marked his attitude on the previous occasion—that
is, he had not helped him or any one but himself.
He was a horrible coward. But what could he do?
he asked himself. What could he do? Tearing off his
coat and vest and shirt as commanded, he began pushing
them into the opening, calling to the others to do the same.
In a twinkling, bundles were made of all as well as of the
sticks and beams afloat in the lock, and with these the gap
in the door was stuffed, sufficiently to prevent the air from
escaping, but shutting out the foreman and his men completely.</p>

<p>“It’s awful. I don’t like to do it,” McGlathery kept crying
to his foreman but the latter was not so easily shaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“It’s all right, boys,” he kept saying. “Have ye no courage
at aal?” And then to the others outside with him,
“Can’t ye stand still and wait? They may be comin’ back
in time. Kape still. Say yer prayers if ye know any, and
don’t be afraid.”</p>

<p>But, although the air pressing outward toward Cavanaugh
held the bundles in place, still this was not sufficient
to keep all the air in or all the water out. It poured about
the dead man and between the chinks, rising inside to their
waists also. Once more it threatened their lives and now
their one hope was to pull open the shoreward door and
so release themselves into the chamber beyond, but this was
not to be done unless the escaping air was completely
blocked or some other method devised.</p>

<p>Cavanaugh, on the outside, his whole mind still riveted
on the men whom he was thus aiding to escape, was the
only one who realized what was to be done. In the panel
of the door which confronted him, and the other, which they
were trying to break open, were thick glass plates, or what
were known as bull’s eyes, through which one could see,
and it was through the one at his end that Cavanaugh was
peering. When it became apparent to him that the men
were not going to be able to open the farthest door, a new
thought occurred to him. Then it was that his voice was
heard above the tumult, shouting:</p>

<p>“Break open the outside bull’s eye! Listen to me,
Dennis! Listen to me! Break open the outside bull’s eye!”</p>

<p>Why did he call to Dennis, the latter often asked himself
afterwards. And why did Dennis hear him so clearly?
Through a bedlam of cries within, he heard, but also realized
that if he or they knocked out the bull’s eye in the
other door, and the air escaped through it inward, the
chances of their opening it would be improved, but the life
of Cavanaugh and his helpless companions would certainly
be destroyed. The water would rush inward from the
river, filling up this chamber and the space in which stood
Cavanaugh. Should he? So he hesitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“Knock it out!” came the muffled voice of his foreman
from within where he was eyeing him calmly. “Knock
it out, Dennis! It’s yer only chance! Knock it out!” And
then, for the first time in all the years he had been working
for him, McGlathery heard the voice of his superior
waver slightly: “If ye’re saved,” it said, “try and do what ye
can fer the rest av us.”</p>

<p>In that moment McGlathery was reborn spiritually. Although
he could have wept, something broke in him—fear.
He was not afraid now for himself. He ceased to tremble,
almost to hurry and awoke to a new idea, one of undying,
unfaltering courage. What! There was Cavanaugh outside
there, unafraid, and here was he, Dennis McGlathery,
scrambling about like a hare for his life! He wanted to
go back, to do something, but what could he? It was useless.
Instead, he assumed partial command in here. The
spirit of Cavanaugh seemed to come over to him and possess
him. He looked about, saw a great stave, and seized it.</p>

<p>“Here, men!” he called with an air of command. “Help
knock it out!” and with a will born of terror and death
a dozen brawny hands were laid on it. With a mighty
burst of energy they assaulted the thick plate and burst it
through. Air rushed in, and at the same time the door
gave way before them, causing them to be swept outward
by the accumulated water like straws. Then, scrambling
to their feet, they tumbled into the next lock, closing the
door behind them. Once in, they heaved a tremendous sigh
of relief, for here they were safe enough—for the time being
anyhow. McGlathery, the new spirit of Cavanaugh in him,
even turned and looked back through the bull’s eye into
the chamber they had just left. Even as they waited for
the pressure here to lower sufficiently to permit them to
open the inner door he saw this last chamber they had left
his foreman and a dozen fellow workers buried beyond. But
what could he do? Only God, only St. Columba, could
tell him, perhaps, and St. Columba had saved him—or had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
he?—him and fifteen other men, the while he had chosen
to allow Cavanaugh and twelve men to perish! Had St.
Columba done that—or God—or who?</p>

<p>“’Tis the will av God,” he murmured humbly—but why
had God done that?</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But somehow, the river was not done with him yet, and
that, seemingly, in spite of himself. Although he prayed
constantly for the repose of the soul of Thomas Cavanaugh
and his men, and avoided the water, until five years later,
still there was a sequel. By now McGlathery was the
father of eight children and as poor as any average laborer.
With the death of Cavanaugh and this accident, as has been
said, he had forsworn the sea—or water—and all its works.
Ordinary house shoring and timbering were good enough for
him, only—only—it was so hard to get enough of this at
good pay. He was never faring as well as he should. And
then one day when he was about as hard up as ever and as
earnest, from somewhere was wafted a new scheme in connection
with this same old tunnel.</p>

<p>A celebrated engineer of another country—England, no
less—had appeared on the scene with a new device, according
to the papers. Greathead was his name, and he had invented
what was known as “The Greathead Shield,” which
finally, with a few changes and adaptations, was to rid tunnel
work of all its dangers. McGlathery, sitting outside the
door of his cottage overlooking Bergen Bay, read it all in the
Evening <em>Clarion</em>, and wondered whether it could be true.
He did not understand very much about this new shield idea
even now, but even so, and in spite of himself, some of the
old zest for tunneling came back to him. What times he
had had, to be sure! What a life it had been, if a dog’s one—and
Cavanaugh—what a foreman! And his body was still
down there entombed—erect, no doubt, as he was left. He
wondered. It would be only fair to dig him out and honor
his memory with a decent grave if it could be done. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
wife and children were still living in Flatbush. It stirred
up all the memories, old fears, old enthusiasms, but no particular
desire to return. Still, here he was now, a man with
a wife and eight children, earning three a day, or less—mostly
less—whereas tunneling paid seven and eight to
such as himself, and he kept thinking that if this should
start up again and men were advertised for, why shouldn’t
he go? His life had been almost miraculously saved these
two times—but would it be again?—that was the great
question. Almost unceasingly he referred the matter to his
saint on Sundays in his church, but receiving no definite
advice as yet and there being no work doing on the tunnel,
he did nothing.</p>

<p>But then one day the following spring the papers were
full of the fact that work would soon actually be resumed,
and shortly thereafter, to his utter amazement, McGlathery
received a note from that same Mr. Henderson under whom
Cavanaugh had worked, asking him to call and see him.
Feeling sure that it was the river that was calling him, he
went over to St. Columba’s and prayed before his saint,
putting a dollar in his Orphans’ box and a candle on his
shrine, and then arising greatly refreshed and reassured, and
after consulting with his wife, journeyed over to the river,
where he found the old supervisor as before in a shed outside,
considering one important matter and another.</p>

<p>What he wanted to know was this—did McGlathery
want to take an assistant-foremanship under a new foreman
who was going to be in charge of the day work here, one
Michael Laverty by name, an excellent man, at seven dollars
a day, seeing that he had worked here before and understood
the difficulties, etc.? McGlathery stared in amazement.
He an assistant-foreman in charge of timbering!
And at seven dollars a day! He!</p>

<p>Mr. Henderson neglected to say that because there had
been so much trouble with the tunnel and the difficulties
so widely advertised, it was rather difficult to get just the
right sort of men at first, although McGlathery was good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
enough any time. But the new shield made everything safe,
he said. There could be no calamity this time. The work
would be pushed right through. Mr. Henderson even went
so far as to explain the new shield to him, its excellent
points.</p>

<p>But McGlathery, listening, was dubious, and yet he was
not thinking of the shield exactly now, nor of the extra
pay he would receive, although that played a big enough
part in his calculations, but of one Thomas Cavanaugh,
mason foreman, and his twelve men, buried down below
there in the ooze, and how he had left him, and how it
would only be fair to take his bones out, his and the others’,
if they could be found, and give them a decent Christian
burial. For by now he was a better Catholic than ever,
and he owed that much to Cavanaugh, for certainly Cavanaugh
had been very good to him—and anyhow, had not
St. Columba protected him so far? And might he not in
the future, seeing the position he was in? Wasn’t this a
call, really? He felt that it was.</p>

<p>Just the same, he was nervous and troubled, and went
home and consulted with his wife again, and thought of the
river and went over and prayed in front of the shrine of
St. Columba. Then, once more spiritualized and strengthened,
he returned and told Mr. Henderson that he would
come back. Yes, he would come.</p>

<p>He felt actually free of fear, as though he had a mission,
and the next day began by assisting Michael Laverty
to get out the solid mass of earth which filled the tunnel
from the second lock outward. It was slow work, well into
the middle of the summer before the old or completed portion
was cleared and the bones of Cavanaugh and his men
reached. That was a great if solemn occasion—the finding
of Cavanaugh and his men. They could recognize him by
his big boots, his revolver, his watch, and a bunch of keys,
all in position near his bones. These same bones and boots
were then reverently lifted and transferred to a cemetery
in Brooklyn, McGlathery and a dozen workers accompanying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
them, after which everything went smoothly. The
new shield worked like a charm. It made eight feet a day in
soft mud, and although McGlathery, despite his revived
courage, was intensely suspicious of the river, he was really no
longer afraid of it in the old way. Something kept telling
him that from now on he would be all right—not to fear.
The river could never hurt him any more, really.</p>

<p>But just the same, a few months later—eight, to be exact—the
river did take one last slap at him, but not so
fatally as might have appeared on the surface, although in
a very peculiar way, and whether with or without St.
Columba’s aid or consent, he never could make out. The
circumstances were so very odd. This new cutting shield,
as it turned out, was a cylinder thirteen feet long, twenty
feet in diameter, and with a hardened steel cutting edge out
on front, an apron, fifteen inches in length and three inches
thick at the cutting edge. Behind this came what was
known as an “outside diaphragm,” which had several openings
to let in the mud displaced by the shield’s advance.</p>

<p>Back of these openings were chambers four feet in length,
one chamber for each opening, through which the mud was
passed. These chambers in turn had hinged doors, which
regulated the quantity of mud admitted, and were water
tight and easily closed. It was all very shipshape.</p>

<p>Behind these little chambers, again, were many steel
jacks, fifteen to thirty, according to the size of the shield,
driven by an air pressure of five thousand pounds to the
square inch, which were used to push the shield forward.
Back of them came what was known as the tail end of the
shield, which reached back into the completed tunnel and
was designed to protect the men who were at work putting
in the new plates (at that danger point which had killed
Cavanaugh) whenever the shield had been driven sufficiently
forward to permit of a new ring of them.</p>

<p>The only danger involved in this part of the work lay
in the fact that between this lining and the tail end of the
shield was always a space of an inch to an inch and a half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
which was left unprotected. This small opening would,
under ordinary circumstances, be insignificant, but in some
instances where the mud covering at the top was very soft
and not very thick, there was danger of the compressed air
from within, pushing at the rate of several thousand pounds
to the square inch, blowing it away and leaving the aperture
open to the direct action of the water above. This
was not anticipated, of course, not even thought of. The
shield was going rapidly forward and it was predicted by
Henderson and Laverty at intervals that the tunnel would
surely go through within the year.</p>

<p>Some time the following winter, however, when the shield
was doing such excellent work, it encountered a rock which
turned its cutting edge and, in addition, necessitated the
drilling out of the rock in front. A bulkhead had to be
built, once sufficient stone had been cut away, to permit
the repairing of the edge. This took exactly fifteen days.
In the meantime, at the back of the shield, at the little
crevice described, compressed air, two thousand pounds to
the square inch, was pushing away at the mud outside,
gradually hollowing out a cup-like depression eighty-five
feet long (Mr. Henderson had soundings taken afterwards),
which extended backward along the top of the completed
tunnel toward the shore. There was then nothing but water
overhead.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the engineers, listening to the
river, which, raked by the outpouring of air from below,
was rolling gravel and stones above the tunnel top and
pounding on it like a drum, learned that such was the
case. It was easy enough to fix it temporarily by stuffing
the crevice with bags, but one of these days when the
shield was repaired it would have to be moved forward
to permit the insertion of a new ring of plates, and then,
what?</p>

<p>At once McGlathery scented trouble. It was the
wretched river again (water), up to its old tricks with him.
He was seriously disturbed, and went to pray before St.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
Columba, but incidentally, when he was on duty, he hovered
about this particular opening like a wasp. He wanted to
know what was doing there every three minutes in the day,
and he talked to the night foreman about it, as well as
Laverty and Mr. Henderson. Mr. Henderson, at Laverty’s
and McGlathery’s request, came down and surveyed it and
meditated upon it.</p>

<p>“When the time comes to move the shield,” he said,
“you’ll just have to keep plenty of bags stuffed around that
opening, everywhere, except where the men are putting in
the plates. We’ll have extra air pressure that day, all we
can stand, and I think that’ll fix everything all right. Have
plenty of men here to keep those bags in position, but don’t
let ’em know there’s anything wrong, and we’ll be all right.
Let me know when you’re ready to start, and I’ll come
down.”</p>

<p>When the shield was eventually repaired and the order
given to drive it just twenty-five inches ahead in order to
permit the insertion of a new ring of plates, Mr. Henderson
was there, as well as Laverty and McGlathery. Indeed,
McGlathery was in charge of the men who were to stuff
the bags and keep out the water. If you have ever seen a
medium-sized red-headed Irishman when he is excited and
determined, you have a good picture of McGlathery. He
was seemingly in fifteen places at once, commanding, exhorting,
persuading, rarely ever soothing—and worried.
Yes, he was worried, in spite of St. Columba.</p>

<p>The shield started. The extra air pressure was put on,
the water began to pour through the crevice, and then the
bags were put in place and stopped most of it, only where
the ironworkers were riveting on the plates it poured, poured
so heavily at times that the workers became frightened.</p>

<p>“Come now! What’s the matter wid ye! What arr ye
standin’ there fer? What arr ye afraid av? Give me that
bag! Up with it! That’s the idea! Do ye think ye’re
goin’ to be runnin’ away now?”</p>

<p>It was McGlathery’s voice, if you please, commanding!—McGlathery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
after his two previous experiences! Yet in
his vitals he was really afraid of the river at this very
moment.</p>

<p>What was it that happened? For weeks after, he himself,
writhing with “bends” in a hospital, was unable to get
it straight. For four of the bags of sawdust burst and blew
through, he remembered that—it was a mistake to have sawdust
bags at all. And then (he remembered that well
enough), in stuffing others in, they found that they were
a bag short, and until something was secured to put in its
place, for the water was streaming in like a waterfall and
causing a flood about their ankles, he, McGlathery, defiant
to the core, not to be outdone by the river this time, commanded
the great thing to be done.</p>

<p>“Here!” he shouted, “the three av ye,” to three gaping
men near at hand, “up with me! Put me there! I’m as
good as a bag of sawdust any day. Up with me!”</p>

<p>Astonished, admiring, heartened, the three of them jumped
forward and lifted him. Against the small breach, through
which the water was pouring, they held him, while others
ran off for more bags. Henderson and Laverty and the
ironworkers, amazed and amused and made braver themselves
because of this very thing—filled with admiration,
indeed, by the sheer resourcefulness of it, stood by to help.
But then, if you will believe it, while they were holding him
there, and because now there was nothing but water above
it, one end of the shield itself—yes, that great iron invention—was
lifted by the tremendous air pressure below—eleven
or thirteen or fourteen inches, whatever space you
can imagine a medium sized man being forced through—and
out he went, McGlathery, and all the bags, up into the
river above, the while the water poured down, and the men
fled for their lives.</p>

<p>A terrific moment, as you can well imagine, not long in
duration, but just long enough to swallow up McGlathery,
and then the shield, having responded at first to too much
air pressure, now responding to too little (the air pressure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
having been lessened by the escape), shut down like a safety
valve, shutting off most of the water and leaving the tunnel
as it was before.</p>

<p>But McGlathery!</p>

<p>Yes, what of him?</p>

<p>Reader—a miracle!</p>

<p>A passing tug captain, steaming down the Hudson at
three one bright December afternoon was suddenly astonished
to see a small geyser of water lift its head some thirty
feet from his boat, and at the top of it, as it were lying on
it, a black object which at first he took to be a bag or a
log. Later he made it out well enough, for it plunged and
bellowed.</p>

<p>“Fer the love av God! Will no one take me out av
this? Git me out av this! Oh! Oh! Oh!”</p>

<p>It was McGlathery right enough, alive and howling lustily
and no worse for his blow-out save that he was suffering
from a fair case of the “bends” and suffering mightily.
He was able to scream, though, and was trying to swim.
That old haunting sensation!—he had had it this time, sure
enough. For some thirty or forty seconds or more he had
been eddied swiftly along the top of the tunnel at the bottom
of the river, and then coming to where the air richocheted
upward had been hustled upward like a cork and
literally blown through the air at the top of the great volume
of water, out into space. The sudden shift from two
thousand pounds of air pressure to none at all, or nearly
none, had brought him down again, and in addition induced
the severe case of “bends” from which he was now suffering.
But St. Columba had not forgotten him entirely.
Although he was suffering horribly, and was convinced
that he was a dead man, still the good saint must have
placed the tug conveniently near, and into this he was now
speedily lifted.</p>

<p>“Well, of all things!” exclaimed Captain Hiram Knox,
seeing him thoroughly alive, if not well, and eyeing him in
astonishment. “Where do you come from?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” bawled McGlathery. “Me arms! Me
ribs! Oh! Oh! Oh! The tunnel! The tunnel below,
av course! Quick! Quick! It’s dyin’ av the bends I am!
Git me to a hospital, quick!”</p>

<p>The captain, truly moved and frightened by his groans, did
as requested. He made for the nearest dock. It took him
but a few moments to call an ambulance, and but a few more
before McGlathery was carried into the nearest hospital.</p>

<p>The house physician, having seen a case of this same
disease two years before, and having meditated on it, had
decided that the hair of the dog must be good for the bite.
In consequence of this McGlathery was once more speedily
carted off to one of the locks of this very tunnel, to the
amazement of all who had known of him (his disappearance
having aroused general excitement), and he was stared at
as one who had risen from the grave. But, what was better
yet, under the pressure of two thousand pounds now applied
he recovered himself sufficiently to be host here and
tell his story—another trick of his guardian saint, no doubt—and
one rather flattering to his vanity, for he was now in
no least danger of dying.</p>

<p>The whole city, if not the whole country, indeed, was
astounded by the accident, and he was a true nine days’
wonder, for the papers were full of the strange adventure.
And with large pictures of McGlathery ascending heavenward,
at the top of a geyser of water. And long and intelligent
explanations as to the way and the why of it all.</p>

<p>But, better yet, four of the happiest weeks of his life were
subsequently spent in that same hospital to which he had first
been taken relating to all and sundry his amazing adventure,
he being interviewed by no less than five representatives of
Sunday editors and eleven reporters for city dailies, all
anxious to discover just how it was that he had been blown
through water and air up through so great a thing as a river,
and how he felt while en route. A triumph.</p>

<p>Rivers may be smart, but saints are smarter, thanks be.</p>

<p>And, to top it all, seeing that his right hand and arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
might possibly be crippled for life, or at least an indefinite
period (the doctors did not know), and in grateful appreciation
of the fact that he had refused to deal with various
wolfish lawyers who had now descended on him and urged
him to sue for a large sum, he was offered a substantial pension
by the company, or its equivalent, work with the company,
no less, at good pay for the rest of his life, and a cash
bonus into the bargain, a thing which seemed to solve his
very uncertain future for him and put him at his ease.
Once more the hand of the saint, you will certainly admit.</p>

<p>But, lastly, there was the peculiar spiritual consolation
that comes with the feeling that you have done your duty
and that a great saint is on your side. For if all these things
did not prove that the good St. Columba had kept faith
with him, what could? To be sure the river had attempted
to do its worst, and had caused him considerable fear and
pain, and perhaps St. Columba did not have as much control
over the river as he should or as he might like to have, or—and
this was far more likely—it was entirely possible that
he (McGlathery) had not at all times deserved the good
saint’s support. But none the less, in the final extremity, had
he not acted? And if not, how would you explain the fact
that the tug <em>Mary Baker</em> was just at hand as he arose out
of the water two thousand feet from shore? And why was
it, if the saint had not been trying to help him, that the hospital
doctor had seen to it that he was hustled off to a lock
just in time—had seen, indeed, just such a case as this
before, and known how to handle it? Incontrovertible facts
all, aren’t they?—or if not, why not?</p>

<p>At any rate McGlathery thought so, and on Sundays and
holidays, whether there was or was not anything of importance
being celebrated in his church, he might have been
seen there kneeling before his favorite saint and occasionally
eyeing him with both reverence and admiration. For,
“Glory be,” as he frequently exclaimed in narrating the
wonderful event afterward, “I wasn’t stuck between the
shield and the tunnel, as I might ’a’ been, and killed entirely,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
and sure, I’ve aaften thought ’tis a miracle that not
enough water come in, just then, to drown ’em aal. It
lifted up just enough to let me go out like a cork, and up
I went, and then, God be praised, it shut down again. But,
glory be, here I am, and I’m no worse fer it, though it do
be that me hand wrenches me now and then.”</p>

<p>And as for the good St. Columba—</p>

<p>Well, what about the good St. Columba?</p>

CONVENTION</h2>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> story was told to me once by a very able newspaper
cartoonist, and since it makes rather clear the
powerfully repressive and often transforming force of convention,
I set it down as something in the nature of an
American social document. As he told it, it went something
like this:</p>

<p>At one time I was a staff artist on the principal paper of
one of the mid-Western cities, a city on a river. It was, and
remains to this hour, a typical American city. No change.
It had a population then of between four and five hundred
thousand. It had its clubs and churches and its conventional
goings-on. It was an excellent and prosperous manufacturing
city; nothing more.</p>

<p>On the staff with me at this time was a reporter whom
I had known a little, but never intimately. I don’t know
whether I ought to bother to describe him or not—physically,
I mean. His physique is unimportant to this story. But I
think it would be interesting and even important to take
him apart mentally and look at him, if one could—sort out
the various components of his intellectual machinery, and so
find out exactly how his intellectual processes proceeded.
However, I can’t do that; I have not the skill. Barring
certain very superficial characteristics which I will mention,
he was then and remains now a psychological mystery to me.
He was what I would describe as superficially clever, a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
writer of a good, practical, matter-of-fact story. He
appeared to be well liked by those who were above him
officially, and he could write Sunday feature stories of a
sort, no one of which, as I saw it, ever contained a moving
touch of color or a breath of real poetry. Some humor he
had. He was efficient. He had a nose for news. He dressed
quite well and he was not ill-looking—tall, thin, wiry,
almost leathery. He had a quick, facile smile, a genial wordflow
for all who knew him. He was the kind of man who
was on practical and friendly terms with many men connected
with the commercial organizations and clubs about town, and
from whom he extracted news bits from time to time. By
the directing chiefs of the paper he was considered useful.</p>

<p>Well, this man and I were occasionally sent out on the
same assignment, he to write the story, I to make sketches—usually
some Sunday feature story. Occasionally we would
talk about whatever was before us—newspaper work, politics,
the particular story in hand—but never enthusiastically or
warmly about anything. He lacked what I thought was the
artistic and poetic point of view. And yet, as I say, we were
friendly enough. I took him about as any newspaperman
takes another newspaperman of the same staff who is in
good standing.</p>

<p>Along in the spring or summer of the second year that I
was on the paper the Sunday editor, to whom I was beholden
in part for my salary, called me into his room and said that
he had decided that Wallace Steele and myself were to do
a feature story about the “love-boats” which plied Saturday
and Sunday afternoons and every evening up and down the
river for a distance of thirty-five miles or more. This distance,
weather permitting, gave an opportunity to six or
seven hundred couples on hot nights to escape the dry,
sweltering heat of the city—and it was hot there in the
summer—and to enjoy the breezes and dance, sometimes by
the light of Chinese lanterns, sometimes by the light of the
full moon. It was delightful. Many, many thousands took
advantage of the opportunity in season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>It was delicious to me, then in the prime of youth and
ambition, to sit on the hurricane or “spoon” deck, as our
Sunday editor called it, and study not only the hundreds of
boys and girls, but also the older men and women, who
came principally to make love, though secondarily to enjoy
the river and the air, to brood over the picturesque groupings
of the trees, bushes, distant cabins and bluffs which
rose steeply from the river, to watch the great cloud of
smoke that trailed back over us, to see the two halves of the
immense steel walking beam chuff-chuffing up and down, and
to listen to the drive of the water-wheel behind. This was
in the days before the automobile, and any such pleasant
means of getting away from the city was valued much more
than it is now.</p>

<p>But to return to this Sunday editor and his orders. I
was to make sketches of spooning couples, or at least of two
or three small distinctive groups with a touch of romance
in them. Steele was to tell how the love-making went on.
This, being an innocent method of amusement, relief from
the humdrum of such a world as this was looked upon with
suspicion if not actual disfavor by the wiseacres of the paper,
as well as by the conservatives of the city. True conservatives
would not so indulge themselves. The real object of
the Sunday editor was to get something into his paper that
would have a little kick to it. We were, without exaggerating
the matter in any way, to shock the conservatives
by a little picture of life and love, which, however innocent,
was none the less taboo in that city. The story was
to suggest, as I understand it, loose living, low ideals and
the like. These outings did not have the lockstep of business
or religion in them.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>Well, to proceed. No sooner had the order been given
than Steele came to me to talk it over. He liked the idea
very much. It was a good Sunday subject. Besides, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
opportunity for an outing appealed to him. We were to
go on the boat that left the wharf at the foot of Beach
street at eight o’clock that evening. He had been told to
write anything from fifteen hundred to two thousand words.
If I made three good sketches, that would make almost a
three-fourths page special. He would make his story as
lively and colorful as he could. He was not a little flattered,
I am sure, by having been called to interpret such a
gay, risqué scene.</p>

<p>It was about one-thirty when we had been called in.
About four o’clock he came to me again. We had, as I had
assumed, tentatively agreed to meet at the wharf entrance
and do the thing together. By now, however, he had
another plan. Perhaps I should say here that up to that
moment I only vaguely knew that he had a wife and child
and that he lived with them somewhere in the southwestern
section of the city, whether in his own home or a rooming-house,
I did not know. Come to think of it, just before this I
believe I had heard him remark to others that his wife was
out of the city. At any rate, he now said that since his
wife was out of the city and as the woman of whom they
rented their rooms was a lonely and a poor person who seldom
got out anywhere, he had decided to bring her along
for the outing. I needn’t wait for him. He would see me
on the boat, or we could discuss the story later.</p>

<p>I agreed to this and was prepared to think nothing of it
except for one thing. His manner of telling me had something
about it, or there was some mood or thought in connection
with it in his own mind, which reached me telepathetically,
and caused me to think that he was taking
advantage of his wife’s absence to go out somewhere with
some one else. And yet, at that, I could not see why I
thought about it. The thing had no real interest for me.
And I had not the least proof and wanted none. As I say,
I was not actually interested. I did not know his wife at
all. I did not care for him or her. I did not care whether
he flirted with some one else or not. Still, this silly, critical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
thought passed through my mind, put into it by him, I am
sure, because he was thinking—at least, might have been
thinking—that I might regard it as strange that he should
appear anywhere with another woman than his wife. Apart
from this, and before this, seeing him buzzing about here and
there, and once talking to a girl on a street corner near the
<em>Mail</em> office, I had only the vague notion that, married or not,
he was a young man who was not averse to slipping away
for an hour or two with some girl whom he knew or casually
met, provided no one else knew anything about it, especially
his wife. But that was neither here nor there. I never gave
the man much thought at any time.</p>

<p>At any rate, seven o’clock coming, I had my dinner at a
little restaurant near the office and went to the boat. It was
a hot night, but clear and certain to bring a lovely full
moon, and I was glad to be going. At the same time, I was
not a little lonely and out of sorts with myself because I
had no girl and was wishing that I had—wishing that some
lovely girl was hanging on my arm and that now we two
could go down to the boat together and sit on the spoon deck
and look at the moon, or that we could dance on the cabin
deck below, where were all the lights and musicians. My
hope, if not my convinced expectation, was that somewhere
on this boat I, too, should find some one who would be interested
in me—I, too, should be able to sit about with the
others and laugh and make love. But I didn’t. The thought
was futile. I was not a ladies’ man, and few if any girls
ever looked at me. Besides, women and girls usually came
accompanied on a trip like this. I went alone, and I returned
alone. So much for me.</p>

<p>Brooding in this fashion, I went aboard along with the
earliest of the arrivals, and, going to the cabin deck, sat
down and watched the others approach. It was one of my
opportunities to single out interesting groups for my pen.
And there were many. They came, so blithe, so very merry,
all of them, in pairs or groups of four or six or eight or ten,
boys and girls of the tenements and the slums—a few older<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
couples among them,—but all smiling and chatting, the last
ones hurrying excitedly to make the boat, and each boy with
his girl, as I was keen to note, and each girl with her beau.
I singled out this group and that, this type and that, making
a few idle notes on my pad, just suggestions of faces, hats,
gestures, swings or rolls of the body and the like. There was
a strong light over the gangway, and I could sketch there.
It was interesting and colorful, but, being very much alone,
I was not very happy about it.</p>

<p>In the midst of these, along with the latter half of the
crowd, came Steele and his lonely landlady, to whom, as he
said, this proffer on his part was a kindness. Because of
what he had said I was expecting a woman who would be
somewhat of a frump—at least thirty-five or forty years old
and not very attractive. But to my surprise, as they came
up the long gangplank which led from the levee and was
lighted by flaring gasoline torches, I saw a young woman who
could not have been more than twenty-seven or -eight at
most—and pretty, very. She had on a wide, floppy, lacy
hat of black or dark blue, but for contrast a pale, cream-colored,
flouncy dress. And she was graceful and plump and
agreeable in every way. Some landlady, indeed, I thought,
looking enviously down and wishing that it was myself and
not he to whose arm she was clinging!</p>

<p>The bounder! I thought. To think that he should be able
to interest so charming a girl, and in the absence of his wife!
And I could get none! He had gone home and changed to a
better suit, straw hat, cane and all, whereas I—I—dub!—had
come as I was. No wonder no really interesting girl
would look at me. Fool! But I remained in position studying
the entering throng until the last couple was on and I
listened to the cries of “Heave off, there!” “Loosen those
stay lines, will you?” “Careful, there!” “Hurry with that
gangplank!” Soon we were in midstream. The jouncy,
tinny music had begun long before, and the couples, scores
and scores of them, were already dancing on the cabin deck,
while I was left to hang about the bar or saunter through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
crowd, looking for types when I didn’t want to be anywhere
but close beside some girl on the spoon deck, who would hang
on my arm, laugh into my eyes, and jest and dance with me.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Because of what he had said, I did not expect Steele to
come near me, and he didn’t. In sauntering about the two
decks looking for arresting scenes I did not see him. Because
I wanted at least one or two spoon deck scenes, I finally fixed
on a couple that was half-hidden in the shadow back of the
pilot-house. They had crumpled themselves up forward of an
air-vent and not far from the two smoke-stacks and under the
walking-beam, which rose and fell above them. The full
moon was just above the eastern horizon, offering a circular
background for them, and I thought they made a romantic
picture outlined against it. I could not see their faces—just
their outlines. Her head was upon his shoulder. His face
was turned, and so concealed, and inclined toward hers. Her
hat had been taken off and was held over her knee by one
hand. I stepped back a little toward a companion-way, where
was a light, in order to outline my impression. When I
returned, they were sitting up. It was Steele and his rooming-house
proprietress! It struck me as odd that of all the
couple and group scenes that I had noted, the most romantic
should have been that provided by Steele and this woman.
His wife would be interested in his solicitude for her loneliness
and her lack of opportunities to get out into the open
air, I was sure. Yet, I was not envious then—just curious
and a little amused.</p>

<p>Well, that was the end of that. The sketches were made,
and the story published. Because he and this girl had provided
my best scene I disguised it a little, making it not seem
exactly back of the pilot-house, since otherwise he might
recognize it. He was, for once, fascinated by the color and
romance of the occasion, and did a better story than I thought
he could. It dwelt on the beauty of the river, the freedom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
from heat, the loveliness of the moon, the dancing. I
thought it was very good, quite exceptional for him, and I
thought I knew the reason why.</p>

<p>And then one day, about a month or six weeks later, being
in the city room, I encountered the wife of Steele and their
little son, a child of about five years. She had stopped in
about three or four in the afternoon, being downtown shopping,
I presume. After seeing him with the young woman
on the steamer, I was, I confess, not a little shocked. This
woman was so pinched, so homely, so faded—veritably a rail
of a woman, everything and anything that a woman, whether
wife, daughter, mother or sweetheart, as I saw it then, should
not be. As a matter of fact, I was too wrought up about
love and youth and marriage and happiness at that time to
rightly judge of the married. At any rate, after having seen
that other woman on that deck with Steele, I was offended
by this one.</p>

<p>She seemed to me, after the other, too narrow, too methodical,
too commonplace, too humdrum. She was a woman
whose pulchritudinous favors, whatever they may have been,
must have been lost at the altar. In heaven’s name, I
thought to myself, how could a man like this come to marry
such a woman? He isn’t so very good-looking himself, perhaps,
but still.... No wonder he wanted to take his
rooming-house landlady for an outing! I would, too. I
could understand it now. In fact, as little as I cared for
Steele, I felt sorry that a man of his years and of his still
restless proclivities should be burdened with such a wife.
And not only that, but there was their child, looking not
unlike him but more like her, one of those hostages to
fortune by reason of which it is never easy to free oneself
from the error of a mistaken marriage. His plight, as I saw
it, was indeed unfortunate. And it was still summer and
there was this other woman!</p>

<p>Well, I was introduced by him as the man who worked on
some of his stories with him. I noticed that the woman had
a thin, almost a falsetto voice. She eyed me, as I thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
unintelligently, yet genially enough. I was invited to come
out to their place some Sunday and take dinner. Because
of his rooming-house story I was beginning to wonder
whether he had been lying to me, when she went on to
explain that they had been boarding up to a few weeks ago,
but had now taken a cottage for themselves and could have
their friends. I promised. Yes, yes. But I never went—not
to dinner, anyhow.</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Then two more months passed. By now it was late fall,
with winter near. The current news, as I saw it, was
decidedly humdrum. There was no local news to speak of.
I scarcely glanced at the papers from day to day, no more
than to see whether some particular illustration I had done
was in and satisfactory or not. But then, of a sudden, came
something which was genuine news. Steele’s wife was laid
low by a box of poisoned candy sent her through the mails,
some of which she had eaten!</p>

<p>Just how the news of this first reached the papers I have
almost forgotten now, but my recollection is that there was
another newspaperman and his wife—a small editor or
reporter on another paper—who lived in the same vicinity,
and that it was to this newspaperman’s wife that Mrs.
Steele, after having called her in, confided that she believed
she had been poisoned, and by a woman whose name she now
gave as Mrs. Marie Davis, and with whom, as she then
announced, her husband had long been intimate—the lady of
the Steamer <em>Ira Ramsdell</em>. She had recognized the handwriting
on the package from some letters written to her
husband, but only after she had eaten of the candy and felt
the pains—not before. Her condition was serious. She was,
it appeared, about to die. In this predicament she had
added, so it was said, that she had long been neglected by
her husband for this other woman, but that she had suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
in silence rather than bring disgrace upon him, herself and
their child. Now this cruel blow!</p>

<p>Forthwith a thrill of horror and sympathy passed over
the city. It seemed too sad. At the same time a cry went up
to find the other woman—arrest her, of course—see if she
had really done it. There followed the official detention,
if not legal arrest, of Mrs. Davis on suspicion of being the
poisoner. Although the charge was not yet proved, she was
at once thrown into jail, and there held to await the death or
recovery of Mrs. Steele, and the proof or disproof of the
charge that the candy had been sent by her. And cameras
in hand, reporters and artists were packed off to the county
jail to hear the accused’s side of the story.</p>

<p>As I at once suspected on hearing the news, she proved to
be none other than the lady of the <em>Ira Ramsdell</em>, and as
charming as I had at first assumed her to be. I, being one
of those sent to sketch her, was among the first to hear her
story. She denied, and very vehemently, that she had sent
any poisoned candy to any one. She had never dreamed of
any such thing. But she did not deny, which at the time
appeared to me to be incriminating, that she had been and
was then in love with Steele. In fact, and this point interested
me as much then as afterwards, she declared that this
was an exceptional passion—her love for him, his love for
her—and no mere passing and vulgar intimacy. A high and
beautiful thing—a sacred love, the one really true and
beautiful thing that had ever come to her—or him—in all
their lives. And he would say so, too. For before meeting
her, Wallace Steele had been very unhappy—oh, very. And
her own marriage had been a failure.</p>

<p>Wallace, as she now familiarly called him, had confessed
to her that this new, if secret, love meant everything to him.
His wife did not interest him. He had married her at a
time when he did not know what he was doing, and before
he had come to be what he was. But this new love had
resolved all their woes into loveliness—complete happiness.
They had resolved to cling only to each other for life.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
There was no sin in what they had done because they loved.
Of course, Wallace had sought to induce Mrs. Steele to
divorce him, but she would not; otherwise they would have
been married before this. But as Mrs. Steele would not give
him up, both had been compelled to make the best of it.
But to poison her—that was wild! A love so beautiful and
true as theirs did not need a marriage ceremony to sanctify
it. So she raved. My own impression at the time was that
she was a romantic and sentimental woman who was really
very greatly in love.</p>

<p>Now as to Steele. Having listened to this blazoning of
her passion by herself, the interviewers naturally hurried to
Steele to see what he would have to say. In contrast to her
and her grand declaration, they found a man, as every one
agreed, who was shaken to the very marrow of his bones by
these untoward events. He was, it appeared, a fit inhabitant
of the environment that nourished him. He was in love,
perhaps, with this woman, but still, as any one could see, he
was not so much in love that, if this present matter were
going to cost him his place in this commonplace, conventional
world, he would not be able to surrender to it. He
was horrified by the revelation of his own treachery. Up to
this hour, no doubt, he had been slipping about, hoping not
to be caught, and most certainly not wishing to be cast out
for sin. Regardless of the woman, he did not wish to be cast
out now. On the contrary, as it soon appeared, he had been
doing his best in the past to pacify his wife and hold her to
silence while he slaked his thirst for romance in this other
way. He did not want his wife, but he did not want trouble,
either. And now that his sin was out he shivered.</p>

<p>In short, as he confided to one of the men who went to
interview him, and who agreed to respect his confidence to
that extent, he was not nearly so much in love with Mrs.
Davis as she thought he was—poor thing! True he had
been infatuated for a while, but only a little while. She
was pretty, of course, and naturally she thought she loved
him—but he never expected anything like this to happen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
Great cripes! They had met at a river bathing-beach the
year before. He had been smitten—well, you know. He
had never got along well with his wife, but there was the
little boy to consider. He had not intended any harm to
any one; far from it. And he certainly couldn’t turn on his
wife now. The public wouldn’t stand for it. It would
make trouble for him. But he could scarcely be expected to
turn on Mrs. Davis, either, could he, now that she was in
jail, and suspected of sending poisoned candy to his wife?
The public wouldn’t stand for that, either.</p>

<p>It was terrible! Pathetic! He certainly would not have
thought that Marie would go to the length of sending his
wife poison, and he didn’t really believe that she had. Still—and
there may have been some actual doubt of her in that
“still,” or so the reporting newspapermen thought. At any
rate, as he saw it now, he would have to stick to his wife
until she was out of danger. Public opinion compelled it.
The general impression of the newspapermen was that he
was a coward. As one of them said of his courage, “Gee,
it’s oozing out of his hair!”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he did go to see Mrs. Davis several times.
But apart from a reported sobbing demonstration of affection
on her part, I never learned what passed between them.
He would not talk and she had been cautioned not to. Also,
there were various interviews with his wife, who had not
died, and now that the storm was on, admitted that she had
intercepted letters between her husband and Mrs. Davis
from time to time. The handwriting on the candy wrapper
the day she received it so resembled the handwriting of
Mrs. Davis that after she had eaten of it and the symptoms
of poisoning had set in—not before—she had begun to suspect
that the candy must have emanated from Mrs. Davis.</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>In the meantime Mrs. Davis, despite the wife’s sad story,
was the major attraction in the newspapers. She was young,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
she was beautiful, she had made, or at least attempted to
make, a blood sacrifice on the altar of love. What more
could a daily newspaper want? She was a heroine, even in
this very moral, conservative, conventional and religious city.
The rank and file were agog—even sympathetic. (How
would the moralists explain that, would you say?) In
consequence of their interest, she was descended upon by a
corps of those women newspaper writers who, even in that
day, were known as sob-sisters, and whose business it was—and
this in advance of any proof of crime or indictment
even—to psychologize and psychiatrize the suspect—to dig
out if they could not only every vestige of her drama, but all
her hidden and secret motives.</p>

<p>As I read the newspapers at the time, they revealed that
she was and she was not a neurotic, a psychotic, who showed
traces of being a shrewd, evasive and designing woman, and
who did not. Also she was a soft, unsophisticated, passionate
and deeply illusioned girl, and she was not. She was guilty,
of course—maybe not—but very likely she was, and she must
tell how, why, in what mood, etc. Also, it appeared that
she had sent the poison deliberately, coldly, murderously.
Her eyes and hands, also the shape of her nose and ears,
showed it. Again, these very things proved she could not
have done it. Had she been driven to it by stress of passionate
emotion and yearning which had been too much for
her to bear? Was she responsible for that—a great, destroying
love? Of course she was! Who is not responsible for
his deeds? A great, overwhelming, destroying love passion,
indeed! Rot! She could help it. She could not help it.
Could she help it? So it went.</p>

<p>Parallel with all this, of course, we were treated to
various examinations of the Steele family. What sort of
people were they, anyhow? It was said of Steele now that
he was an average, fairly capable newspaperman of no very
startling ability, but of no particular vices—one who had
for some years been a serious and faithful employé of this
paper. Mrs. Steele, on the other hand, was a good woman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
but by no means prepossessing. She was without romance,
imagination, charm. One could see by looking at her and
then looking at so winsome and enticing a woman as Mrs.
Davis why Steele had strayed. It was the old eternal triangle—the
woman who was not interesting, the woman who
was interesting, and the man interested by the more interesting
woman. There was no solving it, but it was all very
sad. One could not help sympathizing with Mrs. Steele,
the wronged woman; and again one could not help sympathizing
with Mrs. Davis, the beautiful, passionate, desirous,
helpless beauty—helpless because she was desirous.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the District Attorney’s office having
taken the case in hand, there were various developments
in that quarter. It was necessary to find out, of course,
where the candy had been purchased, how it had been
drugged, with what it had been drugged, where the drug
had been purchased. Chemists, detectives and handwriting
experts were all set to work. It was no trouble to determine
that the drug was arsenic, yet where this arsenic was
purchased was not so easy to discover. It was some time
before it was found where it had been procured. Dissimilarly,
it was comparatively easy to prove where the candy
had come from. It had been sent in the original box of a
well-known candy firm. Yet just who had purchased it
was not quite so easy to establish. The candy company could
not remember, and Mrs. Davis, although admitting that
the handwriting did resemble hers, denied ever having addressed
the box or purchased any candy from the firm in
question. She was quite willing to go there and be identified,
but no clerk in the candy-store was able to identify her as
one woman who had purchased candy. There were one or
two clerks who felt sure that there had been a woman there
at some time or other who had looked like her, but they were
not positive. However, there was one girl who had worked
in the store during the week in which the candy had been
purchased, and who was not there any longer. This was a
new girl who had been tried out for that week only and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
had since disappeared. Her name was known, of course,
and the newspapers as well as the District Attorney’s office
at once began looking for her.</p>

<p>There were some whispers to the effect that not only Mrs.
Davis but Steele himself might have been concerned in the
plot, or Steele alone, since apparently he had been anxious
to get rid of his wife. Why not? He might have imitated
the handwriting of Mrs. Davis or created an accidental likeness
to it. Also, there were dissenting souls, even in the
office of the paper on which I worked, who thought that
maybe Mrs. Steele had sent the candy to herself in order to
injure the other woman. Why not? It was possible.
Women were like that. There had been similar cases, had
there not? Argument! Contention! “She might have
wanted to die and be revenged on the other woman at the
same time, might she not?” observed the railroad editor.
“Oh, hell! What bunk!” called another. “No woman
would kill herself to make a place for a rival. That’s crazy.”
“Well,” said a third, “she might have miscalculated the
power of her own dope. Who knows? She may not have
intended to take as much as she did.” “Oh, Christ,” called
a fourth from somewhere, “just listen to the Sherlock Holmes
Association in session over there! Lay off, will you?”</p>

<p>A week or more went by, and then the missing girl who
had worked in the candy-store was found. She had left
the city the following week and gone to Denver. Being
shown the pictures of Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Steele and some
others and asked whether on any given day she had sold any
of them a two-pound box of candy, she seemed to recall no
one of them save possibly Mrs. Steele. But she could not
be sure from the photograph. She would have to see the
woman. In consequence, and without any word to the
newspapers who had been leading the case up to then, this
girl was returned to the city. Here, in the District Attorney’s
office, she was confronted by a number of women gathered
for the occasion, among whom was placed Mrs. Davis.
But on looking them all over she failed to identify any one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
of them. Then Mrs. Steele, who was by then up and around,
was sent for. She came, along with a representative of the
office. On sight, as she entered the door, and although there
were other women in the room at the time, this girl exclaimed:
“There she is! That’s the woman! Yes, that’s
the very woman!” She was positive.</p>


<h3>VI</h3>

<p>As is customary in such cases, and despite the sympathy
that had been extended to her, Mrs. Steele was turned over
to criminologists, who soon extracted the truth from her.
She broke down and wept hysterically.</p>

<p>It was she who had purchased the candy and poisoned it.
Her life was going to pieces. She had wanted to die, so she
said now. She had addressed the wrapper about the candy,
as some of the wiseacres of our paper had contended, only she
had first made a tracing on the paper from Mrs. Davis’ handwriting,
on an envelope addressed to her husband, and had
then copied that. She had put not arsenic, but rat poison,
bought some time before, into the candy, and in order to
indict Mrs. Davis, she had put a little in each piece, about
as much as would kill a rat, so that it would seem as though
the entire box had been poisoned by her. She had got the
idea from a case she had read about years before in a newspaper.
She hated Mrs. Davis for stealing her husband. She
had followed them.</p>

<p>When she had eaten one of the pieces of candy she had
thought, as she now insisted, that she was taking enough to
make an end of it all. But before taking it she had made
sure that Mrs. Dalrymple, the wife of the newspaperman
whom she first called to her aid, was at home in order that
she might call or send her little boy. Her purpose in doing
this was to instil in the mind of Mrs. Dalrymple the belief
that it was Mrs. Davis who had sent the poison. When she
was gone, Mrs. Davis would be punished, her husband would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
not be able to have her, and she herself would be out of her
misery.</p>

<p>Result: the prompt discharge of Mrs. Davis, but no
charge against Mrs. Steele. According to the District Attorney
and the newspapers who most truly reflected local sentiment,
she had suffered enough. And, as the state of public
feeling then was, the District Attorney would not have
dared to punish her. Her broken confession so reacted on
the public mind that now, and for all time, it was for Mrs.
Steele, just as a little while before it was rather for Mrs.
Davis. For, you see, it was now proved that it was Mrs.
Steele and not Mrs. Davis who had been wrought up to
that point emotionally where she had been ready and willing—had
actually tried—to make a blood sacrifice of herself and
another woman on the altar of love. In either case it was
the blood sacrifice—the bare possibility of it, if you choose—that
lay at the bottom of the public’s mood, and caused it to
turn sympathetically to that one who had been most willing
to murder in the cause of love.</p>

<p>But don’t think this story is quite ended. Far from it.
There is something else here, and a very interesting something
to which I wish to call your attention. I have said
that the newspapers turned favorably to Mrs. Steele. They
did. So did the sob-sisters, those true barometers of public
moods. Eulogies were now heaped upon Mrs. Steele, her
devotion, her voiceless, unbearable woe, the tragedy of her
mood, her intended sacrifice of herself. She was now the
darling of these journalistic pseudo-analysts.</p>

<p>As for Mrs. Davis—not a word of sympathy, let alone
praise or understanding for her thereafter. Almost unmentioned,
if you will believe it, she was, and at once allowed
to slip back into the limbo of the unheralded, the subsequently-to-be-unknown.
From then on it was almost as
though she had never been. For a few weeks, I believe, she
retired to the home in which she had lived; then she disappeared
entirely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>But now as to Steele. Here was the third peculiar phase
of the case. Subsequent to the exculpation of Mrs. Davis
and her noiseless retirement from the scene, what would you
say his attitude would have been, or should have been?
Where would he go? What do? What attitude would he
assume? One of renewed devotion to his wife? One of
renewed devotion to Mrs. Davis? One of disillusion or
indifference in regard to all things? It puzzled me, and I
was a rank outsider with no least concern, except of course
our general concern in all such things, so vital to all of us
in our sex and social lives. But not only was it a puzzle
to me; it was also a puzzle to others, especially those who
were identified with the newspaper business in the city, the
editors and the city editors and managing editors who had
been following the wavering course of things with uncertain
thoughts and I may say uncertain policy. They had been, as
you may guess, as prepared to hang Steele as not, assuming
that he had been identified with Mrs. Davis in a plot to do
away with his wife. On the other hand, now that that
shadow was removed and it was seen to be a more or less
simple case of varietism on his part, resulting in marital
unhappiness for his wife and a desire on her part to die, they
were prepared to look upon him and this result with a more
kindly eye. After all, she was not dead. Mrs. Davis had
been punished. And say what you will, looking at Mrs.
Steele as she was, and at Mrs. Davis as she was—well—with
a certain amount of material if not spiritual provocation—what
would you?</p>

<p>Indeed, the gabble about the newspaper offices was all to
the above effect. What, if anything, finally asked some of
the city editors and managing editors, was to be done about
Steele? Now that everything had blown over, what of him?
Go on hounding him forever? Nonsense! It was scarcely
fair, and, anyhow, no longer profitable or worth while. Now
that the storm was passing, might not something be done for
him? After all, he had been a fairly respectable newspaperman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
and in good standing. Why not take him back? And
if not that, how was he to be viewed in future by his friends?
Was he to be let alone, dropped, forgotten, or what? Was
he going to stay here in G——, and fight it out, or leave?
And if he was going to leave or stay, with whom was he
going to leave or stay? Semikindly, semiselfish curiosity,
as you see.</p>


<h3>VII</h3>

<p>The thing to do, it was finally decided among several of
those on our paper and several on other papers who had
known him more or less intimately, was to go to Steele himself,
and ask him, not for publicity but just between ourselves,
what was to be done, what he proposed to do, whether there
was anything now that the local newspapers could say or do
which would help him in any way? Did he want to be
restored to a staff position? Was he going to stick to his
wife? What, if anything, and with no malicious intent,
should they say about Mrs. Davis? In a more or less secret
and brotherly or professional spirit they were going to put
it up to him and then leave it there, doing whatever they
could in accordance with what he might wish.</p>

<p>Accordingly, two of the local newsmen whom he quite
honestly respected visited him and placed the above several
propositions before him. They found him, as I was told
afterwards, seated upon the front porch of the very small
and commonplace house in which after the dismissal of the
charge against Mrs. Davis, he and his wife had been dwelling,
reading a paper. Seated with him was Mrs. Steele,
thinner and more querulous and anemic and unattractive than
before. And upon the lot outside was their little son. Upon
their arrival, they hailed Steele for a private word, and Mrs.
Steele arose and went into the house. She looked, said one
of these men, as though she expected more trouble. Steele,
on his part, was all smiles and genial tenderings of hospitality.
He was hoping for the best, of course, and he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
anxious to do away with any new source of trouble. He
even rubbed his hands, and licked his lips. “Come right in,
boys. Come on up on the porch. Wait a minute and I’ll
bring out a couple of chairs.” He hastened away but quickly
returned, determined, as they thought, to make as good an
impression as possible.</p>

<p>After he had heard what they had come for—most tactfully
and artfully put, of course—he was all smiles, eager,
apparently, to be well thought of once more. To their
inquiry as to whether he proposed to remain or not, he
replied: “Yes, for the present.” He had not much choice.
He had not saved enough money in recent days to permit
him to do much of anything else, and his wife’s illness and
other things had used up about all he had. “And now, just
between ourselves, Steele,” asked one of the two men who
knew him better than the other, “what about Mrs. Davis
and your wife? Just where do you stand in regard to them?
Are you going to stick to your wife or are you going with
the other woman eventually? No trouble for you, you understand—no
more publicity. But the fellows on the papers
are in a little bit of a quandary in regard to this. They
don’t intend to publish anything more—nothing disparaging.
They only want to get your slant on the thing so that if
anything more does come up in connection with this they can
fix it so that it won’t be offensive to you, you see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I see,” replied Steele cheerfully and without much
reflection. “But so far as that Davis woman is concerned,
though, you can forget her. I’m through with her. She
was never much to me, anyhow, just a common——.”
Here he used the good old English word for prostitute. As
for his wife, he was going to stick by her, of course. She
was a good woman. She loved him. There was his little
boy. He was through with all that varietistic stuff. There
was nothing to it. A man couldn’t get away with it—and
so on.</p>

<p>The two men, according to their account of it afterward,
winced not a little, for, as they said, they had thought from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
all that had gone before that there had surely been much
more than common prostitution between Steele and the
woman. How could all this have been in the face of Mrs.
Steele’s great jealousy, Mrs. Davis’ passionate declaration
about pure, spiritual and undying love? Imagine it! After
a few more words the men left, convinced that whether interested
in his wife or not or Mrs. Davis or not, Steele was
literally terrorized by convention,—and to the point where
he was floundering about for an excuse. He was weak and
he wanted to put the best face on the situation that he could.
As one of the newspapermen afterward expressed it, “there
was something unpleasant about it all.” Just why had he
changed so quickly? Why the gratuitous insult to Mrs.
Davis? Why, after the previous acknowledgment of an affection
of sorts at least for her, was he now willing to write
himself down a bounder and a cad in this open and offensive
way? For a cad he plainly was. Mrs. Davis could not be
as shabby as he had made her out. This was at once and
generally agreed upon. That finally fixed Steele’s position
in G—— as a bounder. He was never again taken back on
any local staff.</p>

<p>And for myself, I could not quite fathom it. The
thing haunted me. What was it that moved him—public
opinion, fear of the loss of the petty social approval which
had once been his, sorrow for his wife—what one special
thing that Mrs. Davis might or might not have done? For
certainly, as things turned out, she had been guilty of nothing
except loving him—illegally, of course, but loving him. My
mind involuntarily flashed back to the two curled abaft the
pilot-house in the moonlight, those quaint, shadowy, romantic
figures. And now this! And then there was dancing
and laughter and love.</p>


<h3>VIII</h3>

<p>But even this is not the end, however ready you may be to
cease listening. There is an <em>envoi</em> that I must add. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
was seven years later. By then I had removed to New York
and established myself as a cartoonist. From others I had
learned that Steele also had come to New York and was now
connected with one of the local papers in some moderately
responsible capacity—copy reading, I think. At any rate,
I met him—one Sunday. It was near the entrance of the
Bronx Zoo, at closing time. He was there with his wife and
a second little son that had come to him since he had left
G——. The first one—a boy of ten by then, I presume—was
not present. All this I learned in the course of the
brief conversation that followed.</p>

<p>But his wife! I can never forget her. She was so worn,
so faded, so impossible. And this other boy by her—a son
who had followed after their reunion! My God! I thought,
how may not fear or convention slay one emotionally! And
to cap it all, he was not so much apologetic as—I will not
say defiant—but ingratiating and volubly explanatory about
his safe and sane retreat from gayety and freedom, and, if
you will, immorality. For he knew, of course, that I recalled
the other case—all its troublesome and peculiar details.</p>

<p>“My wife! My wife!” he exclaimed quickly, since I did
not appear to recognize her at first, and with a rather grandiose
gesture of the hand, as who should say, “I am proud
of my wife, as you see. I am still married to her and rightly
so. I am not the same person you knew in G—— at all—at
all!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I replied covering them all with a single glance.
“I remember your wife very well. And your boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not that boy,” he hastened to explain. “That
was Harry. This is another little boy—Francis.” And
then, as though to re-establish his ancient social prestige with
me, he proceeded to add: “We’re living over on Staten
Island now—just at the north end, near the ferry, you
know. You must come down some time. It’s a pleasant ride.
We’ll both be so glad to see you. Won’t we, Estelle?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly,” said Mrs. Steele.</p>

<p>I hastened away as quickly as possible. The contrast was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
too much; that damned memory of mine, illegitimate as it
may seem to be, was too much. I could not help thinking of
the <em>Ira Ramsdell</em> and of how much I had envied him the
dances, the love, the music, the moonlight.</p>

<p>“By God!” I exclaimed as I walked away. “By God!”</p>

<p>And that is exactly how I feel now about all such miscarriages
of love and delight—cold and sad.</p>

buy and chew it, the poor by the anna’s worth, the rich by
the rupee. The beggar when he can beg or steal it—even
he is happy too.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> dawn had long since broken over the heat-weary
cup and slopes of the Mugga Valley, in which lies
Hodeidah. In the centre of the city, like a mass of upturned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
yellow cups and boxes surrounded by a ring of green
and faced by the sea, were the houses, with their streets and
among and in them the shopkeepers of streets or ways busy
about the labors of the day. Al Hajjaj, the cook, whose place
was near the mosque in the centre of the public square, had
already set his pots and pans over the fire and washed his
saucers and wiped his scales and swept his shop and sprinkled
it. And indeed his fats and oils were clear and his spices
fragrant, and he himself was standing behind his cooking
pots ready to serve customers. Likewise those who dealt
in bread, ornaments, dress goods, had put forth such wares
as they had to offer. In the mosque a few of the faithful
had entered to pray. Over the dust of the ill-swept street,
not yet cleared of the rubbish of the day before, the tikka
gharries of the better-to-do dragged their way along the
road about various errands. The same was speckled with
natives in bright or dull attire, some alive with the interest
of business, others dull because of a life that offered little.</p>

<p>In his own miserable wattle-covered shed or hut, no
more than an abandoned donkey’s stall at the edge of the
city, behold Ibn Abdullah. Beggar, ne’er-do-well, implorer
of charity before the mosque, ex-water-carrier and tobacco
seller in Mecca and Medina, from whence he had been
driven years before by his extortions and adulterations, he
now turned wearily, by no means anxious to rise although it
was late. For why rise when you are old and weary and
ragged, and life offers at best only a little food and sleep—or
not so much food as (best and most loved of all earthly
blessings) khat, the poor man’s friend? For that, more than
food or drink, he craved. Yet how to come by it was a
mystery. There was about him not a single anna wherewith
to sate his needs—not so much as a pice!</p>

<p>Indeed, as Ibn Abdullah now viewed his state, he had
about reached the end of his earthly tether. His career
was and had been a failure. Born in the mountain district
back of Hodeidah, in the little village of Sabar, source
of the finest khat, where formerly his father had been a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
khat farmer, his mother a farmer’s helper, he had wandered
far, here and there over Arabia and elsewhere, making a
living as best he might: usually by trickery. Once for a
little while he had been a herdsman with a Bedouin band,
and had married a daughter of the tribe, but, restlessness
and a lust of novelty overcoming him, he had, in time,
deserted his wife and wandered hence. Thence to Jiddah,
the port of debarkation for pilgrims from Egypt and Central
Africa approaching Mecca and Medina, the birthplace
and the burialplace of the Prophet. Selling trinkets and
sacred relics, water and tobacco and fruit and food, and betimes
indulging in trickery and robbery, he had finally been
taken in the toils of the Cadis of both Mecca and Medina, by
whose henchmen he had been sadly drubbed on his back and
feet and ordered away, never to return. Venturing once
more into the barren desert, a trailer of caravans, he had
visited Taif, Taraba and Makhwa, but finding life tedious
in these smaller places he had finally drifted southward
along the coast of the Red Sea to the good city of Hodeidah,
where, during as many as a dozen years now, he had been
eking out a wretched existence, story-telling, selling tobacco
(when he could get it) or occasionally false relics to the
faithful. Having grown old in this labor, his tales commonplace,
his dishonesty and lack of worth and truth well
known, he was now weary and helpless, truly one near an
unhonored end.</p>

<p>Time was, in his better days and greater strength, as he
now bethought him on this particular morning, when he
had had his full share of khat, and food too. Ay-ee!
There had been some excellent days in the past, to be
sure! Not even old Raschid, the khat drunkard, or Al
Hajjaj, the cook, who might be seen of a late afternoon
before his shop, his pillow and carpets and water chatties
about him, his narghili lit, a bunch of khat by his side, his
wife and daughter at the window above listening to him
and his friends as they smoked or chewed and discoursed,
had more of khat and food than had he. By Allah, things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
were different then! He had had his girls, too, his familiar
places in the best of the mabrazes, where were lights and
delightful strains of song, and dancing betimes. He had
sung and applauded and recounted magnificent adventures
with the best of them. Ay-ee!</p>

<p>But of late he had not done well—not nearly as well
as in times past. He was very, very old now, that was
the reason; his bones ached and even creaked. An undue
reputation for evil things done in the past—Inshallah! no
worse than those of a million others—pursued him wherever
he went. It was remembered of him, unfortunately, here
in Hodeidah, as in Mecca and Medina (due no doubt to
the lying, blasting tongue—may it wither in his mouth!—of
Tahrbulu, the carrier, whom he had known in Mecca)—that
he had been bastinadoed there for adulterating the
tobacco he sold—a little dried goats’ and camels’ dung, wind-blown
and clean; and as for Taif, to which place he had
gone after Mecca, Firaz, the ex-caravan guard who had
known him in that place—the dog!—might his bones wither
in the sun!—had recalled to various and sundry that at
Mecca he had been imprisoned for selling water from a
rain-pit as that of the sacred well of Jezer! Be it so; he
was hard pressed at the time; there was no place to turn;
business was poor—and great had been his yearning for
khat.</p>

<p>But since then he had aged and wearied and all his
efforts at an honest livelihood had served him ill. Betimes
his craving for khat had grown, the while his ability to
earn it—aye, even to beg it with any success!—had decreased.
Here in Hodeidah he was too well known (alas,
much too well known!), and yet where else was he to go?
By sea it was all of three hundred miles to Aden, a great
and generous place, so it was said, but how was he to get
there at his time of life? No captain would carry him. He
would be tossed into the sea like a rat. Had he not begged
and been roundly cursed? And to Jiddah, whereby thousands
came to Mecca, a full five hundred miles north, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
dare not return. Were he there, no doubt he would do
better: the faithful were generous.... But were he
caught in the realm of the Grand Sherif— No; Hodeidah
had its advantages.</p>

<p>He arose after a time, and, without ablutions, prostrating
himself weakly in the direction of Mecca, adjusted his
ragged loin- and shoulder-cloths and prepared to emerge
for the day. Although hungry and weak, it was not food
but khat that he desired, a few leaves of the green, succulent,
life-giving plant that so restored his mood and
strength and faculties generally. By Allah, if he had
but a little, a handful, his thoughts concerning life would
be so much more endurable. He might even, though
cracked and wretched was his voice, tell a tale or two to
idlers and so earn an honest anna. Or he would have more
courage to beg, to lie, to mourn before the faithful. Yea,
had he not done so often? With it he was as good as any
man, as young, as hopeful; without it—well, he was as he
was: feeble and worn.</p>

<p>As he went forth finally along the hot, dusty road which
led into the city and the public market and mosque, lined on
either side by low one-story mud houses of the poor, windowless,
and with the roadway in front as yet unswept, his
thoughts turned in eager seeking to the khat market, hard
by the public square and beyond the mosque, whose pineapple-shaped
dome he could even now see rising in the
distance over the low roofs before him. Here it was that
at about eleven o’clock in the morning the khat camels
bearing their succulent loads would come winding along
the isthmus road from the interior. He could see them
now, hear their bells, the long striding camels, their shouting
drivers, the green herb, wet and sweet, piled in refreshing
masses upon their backs! How well he knew the process
of its arrival—the great rock beyond the Jiddah gate casting
a grateful shade, the two little black policemen ready
to take custom toll of each load and give a receipt, the huge
brutes halting before the door of the low kutcha-thatched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
inn, there to pick at some wisps of grass while their masters
went inside to have a restful pull at a hubbuk (water-pipe)
and a drink of kishr, or maybe a bowl of curds.
Meanwhile, a flock of shrewd youngsters, bribelings of the
merchants of the bazaars within the city, would flit about
the loaded animals, seeking to steal a leaf or to thrust an
appraising glance into the closely wrapped bundles, in order
that they might report as to the sweetness and freshness of
their respective loads.</p>

<p>“What, O <em>kowasji</em>, is the quality of your khat to-day?
Which beast carries the best, and has thy driver stinted no
water on the journey to keep it fresh?”</p>

<p>To find true answers to these questions had these urchins
taken their bribe-money in the bazaars. But the barefoot
policeman would chase them away, the refreshed drivers
would come out again, fiercely breathing calumnies against
the grandmothers of such brats, and the little caravan would
pick its way upward and downward again into the market.</p>

<p>But to-day, too weary to travel so far, even though by
sighs and groans and many prayers for their well-being he
might obtain so little as a leaf or two from the comfortable
drivers, he betook himself slowly toward the market itself.
En route, and especially as he neared a better portion of
the city, where tikka gharries might be seen, he was not
spareful of “Alms, in the name of Allah! Allah! Alms!”
or “May thy hours in paradise be endless!” But none
threw him so much as a pice. Instead, those who recognized
his familiar figure, the sad antithesis of all industry and
well-being, turned away or called: “Out of the way, thou
laggard! To one side, dog!”</p>

<p>When he reached the market, however, not without having
cast a wishful eye at the shining pots and saucers of
Al Hajjaj en route, the adjoining bazaar had heard of the
coming of the green-laden caravan, and from the dark
shops, so silent until now, cheerful cries were beginning to
break forth. Indeed the streets were filled with singing
and a stream of lean figures all headed one way. Like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
himself they were going to the khat market, only so much
better equipped for the occasion—rupees and anna in plenty
for so necessary and delectable an herb. Tikka gharries rattled
madly past him, whips were waved and turbans pushed
awry; there were flashes of color from rich men’s gowns,
as they hurried to select the choicest morsels, the clack of
oryx-hide sandals, and the blunt beating of tom-toms. As
the camels arrived in the near distance, the market was
filled with a restless, yelling mob. Bedlam had broken
loose, but a merry, good-natured bedlam at that. For khat,
once obtained, would ease whatever ill feeling or morning
unrest or weariness one might feel.</p>

<p>Although without a pice wherewith to purchase so much
as a stalk, still Ibn could not resist the temptation of entering
here. What, were none of the faithful merciful? By
Allah, impossible! Perchance—who knows?—there might
be a stranger, a foreigner, who in answer to his appealing
glance, his outstretched hands, an expression of abject despair
which long since he had mastered, would cast him
an anna, or even a rupee (it had happened!), or some one,
seeing him going away empty-handed or standing at the
gate outside, forlorn and cast down, and asking always alms,
alms, would cast him a delicious leaf or spray of the surpassing
delight.</p>

<p>But no; this day, as on the day previous, and the one
before that, he had absolutely no success. What was it—the
hand of fate itself? Had Allah truly forsaken him at
last? In a happy babel, and before his very eyes, the
delicious paradisiacal stimulant was weighed on government
scales and taxed again—the Emir must live! And then,
divided into delicious bundles the thickness of a man’s forearm,
it was offered for sale. Ah, the beauty of those bundles—the
delight therein contained—the surcease even now!
The proud sellers, in turban and shirt, were mounting the
small tables or stands about the place and beginning to
auction it off, each bundle bringing its own price. “Min
kam! Min kam!” Hadji, the son of Dodow, was now crying—Hadji,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
whom Ibn had observed this many a day as a
seller here. He was waving a bunch above the outstretched
hands of the crowd. “How much? How much will you give
for this flower of paradise, this bringer of happiness, this
dispeller of all weakness? ’Tis as a maiden’s eyes. ’Tis like
bees’ breath for fragrance. ’Tis—”</p>

<p>“That I might buy!” sighed Ibn heavily. “That I might
buy! Who will give me so much as a spray?”</p>

<p>“One anna” (two cents), yelled a mirthful and contemptuous
voice, knowing full well the sacrilege of the offer.</p>

<p>“Thou scum! O thou miserable little tick on the back of
a sick camel!” replied the seller irritably. “May my nose
grow a beard if it is not worth two rupees at the very
least!”</p>

<p>“Bismillah! There is not two rupees’ worth in all thy
filthy godown, <em>budmash</em>!”</p>

<p>“Thou dog! Thou detractor! But why should one pay
attention to one who has not so much as an anna wherewith
to ease himself? To those who have worth and many
rupees—look, behold, how green, how fresh!”</p>

<p>And Al Hajjaj, the cook, and Ahmed, the carpet-weaver,
stepped forward and took each a bunch for a rupee, the
while Ibn Abdullah, hanging upon the skirt of the throng
and pushed contemptuously here and there, eyed it all sadly.
Other bundles in the hands of other sellers were held up
and quickly disposed of—to Chudi, the baker, Azad Bakht,
the barber, Izz-al-Din, the seller of piece goods, and so on,
until within the hour all was exhausted and the place deserted.
On the floor was now left only the litter and
débris of stems and deadened leaves, to be haggled over by
the hadjis (vendors of firewood), the sweepers, scavengers
and beggars generally, of whom he was one; only for the
want of a few pice, an anna at the most, he would not even
now be allowed to carry away so much as a stem of this, so
ill had been his fortunes these many, many days. In this
pell-mell scene, where so many knew him and realized the
craving wherewith he was beset, not one paused to offer him a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
sprig. He was as wretched as before, only hungrier and
thirstier.</p>

<p>And then, once the place was finally deserted, not a leaf
or a stem upon the ground, he betook himself slowly and
wearily to his accustomed place in the shadow of one of
the six columns which graced the entryway of the mosque
(the place of beggars), there to lie and beseech of all who
entered or left that they should not forget the adjuration
of the Prophet “and give thy kinsman his due and the poor
and the son of the road.” At noon he entered with others
and prayed, for there at least he was welcome, but alas,
his thoughts were little on the five prescribed daily prayers
and the morning and evening ablutions—no, not even upon
food, but rather upon khat. How to obtain it—a leaf—a
stem!</p>

<p>Almost perforce his thoughts now turned to the days of
his youth, when as a boy living on the steep terraced slope
of the mountains between Taiz and Yerim, he was wont
literally to dwell among the small and prosperous plantations
of the khat farmers who flourished there in great numbers.
Indeed, before his time, his father had been one such,
and Sabar and Hirwa, two little villages in the Taiz district,
separated only by a small hill, and in the former of
which he was born, were famous all over Arabia for the
khat that was raised there. Next to that which came from
Bokhari, the khat of Sabar, his home town, was and remained
the finest in all Yemen. Beside it even that of
Hirwa was coarse, thin and astringent, and more than once
he had heard his mother, who was a khat-picker, say that
one might set out Sabari plants in Hirwa and that they
quickly became coarse, but remove Hirwa plants to Sabar,
and they grew sweet and delicate.</p>

<p>And there as a child he—who could not now obtain even
so much as a leaf of life-giving khat!—had aided his mother
in picking or cutting the leaves and twigs of khat that constituted
the crops of this region—great camel-loads of it!
In memory now he could see the tasks of the cooler months,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
where, when new fields were being planted, they were
started from cuttings buried in shallow holes four to six
inches apart with space enough between the rows for pickers
to pass; how the Yemen cow and the sad-eyed camel, whose
maw was never full, had to be guarded against, since they
had a nice taste in cuttings, and thorn twigs and spiny cactus
leaves had to be laid over the young shoots to discourage
the marauders.</p>

<p>At the end of a year the young shrubs, now two feet
high, had a spread of thick green foliage eighteen inches in
diameter. Behold now the farmer going out into the dawn
of each morning to gaze at his field and the sky, in the hope
of seeing the portents of harvest time. On a given morning
the air would be thick with bulbuls, sparrows, weaver
birds, shrilly clamoring; they would rise and fall above
the plants, picking at the tenderest leaves. “Allah be
praised!” would cry the farmer in delight. “The leaves
are sweet and ripe for the market!” And now he would
call his women and the wives of his neighbors to the crop-picking.
Under a bower of jasmine vines, with plumes of
the sweet smelling <em>rehan</em>, the farmer and his cronies would
gather to drink from tiny cups and smoke the hubbuk, while
the womenfolk brought them armfuls of the freshly cut
khat leaves. What a joyous time it was for all the village,
for always the farmer distributed the whole of his first
crop among his neighbors, in the name of Allah, that
Allah’s blessings might thus be secured on all the succeeding
ones. Would that he were in Sabar or Hirwa once more!</p>

<p>But all this availed him nothing. He was sick and
weary, with little strength and no money wherewith to
return; besides, if he did, the fame of his evil deeds would
have preceded him perhaps. Again, here in Hodeidah,
as elsewhere in Arabia, the cities and villages especially,
khat-chewing was not only an appetite but a habit, and
even a social custom or function, with the many, and required
many rupees the year to satisfy. Indeed one of the
painful things in connection with all this was that, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
unlike eating in other countries, or tea at least, it had come
to involve a paraphernalia and a ritual all its own, one
might say. At this very noon hour here in Hodeidah,
when, because of his luck, he was here before the temple
begging instead of having a comfortable home of his own,
hundreds—aye, thousands—who an hour earlier might have
been seen wending their way happily homeward from the
market, their eyes full of a delicious content, their jaws
working, a bundle of the precious leaves under their arms,
might now be found in their private or public mabraz making
themselves comfortable, chewing and digesting this same,
and not until the second hour of the afternoon would they
again be seen. They all had this, their delight, to attend to!</p>

<p>Aye, go to the house of any successful merchant,
(only the accursed Jews and the outlanders did not use
khat) between these hours and say that you had urgent
news for him or that you had come to buy a lakh of rupees’
worth of skins.... His servant would meet you on the
verandah (accursed dogs! How well he knew them and
their airs!) and offer the profoundest apologies ... the
master would be unutterably sick (here he would begin to
weep), or his sister’s husband’s aunt’s mother had died this
very morning and full of unutterable woe as he was he
would be doing no business; or certainly he had gone to
Tawahi but assuredly would return by three. Would the
caller wait? And at that very moment the rich dog would
be in his mabraz at the top of his house smoking his hubbuk
and chewing his leaves—he who only this morning had refused
Ibn so much as a leaf! Bismillah! Let him rot like
a dead jackal!</p>

<p>Or was it one who was less rich? Behold the public
mabraz, such as he—Ibn—dared not even look into save as
a wandering teller of tales, or could only behold from afar.
For here these prosperous swine could take their ease in the
heat of the day, cool behind trellised windows of these same,
or at night could dream where were soft lights and faint
strains of song, where sombre shadow-steeped figures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
swayed as though dizzy with the sound of their own voices,
chanting benedictions out of the Koran or the Prophets. Had
he not told tales for them in his time, the uncharitable dogs?
Even now, at this noon hour, one might see them, the habitués
of these same well-ventilated and well-furnished public rooms,
making off in state for their favorite diversion, their khat
tied up in a bright shawl and conspicuously displayed—for
whom except himself, so poor or so low that he could not
afford a little?—and all most anxious that all the world
should know that they went thus to enjoy themselves. In
the mabraz, each one his rug and pillow arranged for him,
he would recline, occupying the space assigned him and
no more. By his side would be the tall narghili or hubbuk,
the two water-pots or chatties on copper stands, and a bowl
of sweets. Bismillah, he was no beggar! When the mabraz
was comfortably filled with customers a servant would come
and light the pipes, some one would produce a Koran or
commence a story—not he any more, for they would not
have him, such was his state—and the afternoon’s pleasure
would begin. Occasionally the taraba (a kind of three-stringed
viol) would be played, or, as it might happen, a
favorite singer be present. Then the happy cries of “<em>Taieeb!</em>”
or “<em>Marhabba! Marhabba!</em>” (Good!), or the more
approbative “O friend, excellent indeed!” would be heard.
How well he remembered his own share in all this in former
years, and how little the knowledge of it all profited
him now—how little! Ah, what a sadness to be old and a
beggar in the face of so much joy!</p>

<p>But as he mused in the shade, uttering an occasional
“Alms, alms, in the name of Allah!” as one or another of
the faithful entered or left the mosque, there came from the
direction of the Jiddah gate, the regular khat-bearing camel
route, shrill cries and yells. Looking up now, he saw a
crowd of boys racing toward the town, shouting as they
ran: “Al khat aja!” (the khat has come), a thing which of
itself boded something unusual—a marriage or special feast
of some kind, for at this late hour for what other reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
would khat be brought? The market was closed; the
chewers of khat already in their mabrazes. From somewhere
also, possibly in the house of a bridegroom, came the
faint tunk-a-lunk of a tom-tom, which now seemed to take
up the glad tidings and beat out its summons to the wedding
guests.</p>

<p>“Bismillah! What means this?” commented the old beggar
to himself, his eyes straining in the direction of the
crowd; then folding his rags about him he proceeded to limp
in the direction of the noise. At the turn of a narrow
street leading into the square his eye was gladdened truly
enough by the sight of a khat-bearing camel, encompassed
by what in all likelihood, and as he well knew was the
custom on such occasions, a cloud of “witnesses” (seekers of
entertainment or food at any feast) to the probable approaching
marriage. Swathed round the belly of the camel
as it came and over its load of dripping green herbs, was
laid a glorious silken cloth, blazing with gold and hung with
jasmine sprays; and though tom-toms thumped and fifes
squealed a furious music all about him, the solemn beast
bore his burden as if it were some majesty of state.</p>

<p>“By Allah,” observed the old beggar wearily yet eyeing
the fresh green khat with zest, “that so much joy should
be and I have not a pice, let alone an anna! Would that
I might take a spray—that one might fall!”</p>

<p>“Friend,” he ventured after a moment, turning to a
water-carrier who was standing by, one almost as poor as
himself if more industrious, “what means this? Has not
Ramazan passed and is not Mohorrum yet to come?”</p>

<p>“Dost thou address me, thou bag of bones?” returned
the carrier, irritated by this familiarity on the part of one
less than himself.</p>

<p>“Sahib,” returned the beggar respectfully, using a term
which he knew would flatter the carrier, no more entitled
to a “Sir” than himself, “use me not ill. I am in sore straits
and weak. Is it for a marriage or a dance, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Thou hast said,” replied the carrier irritably, “—of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
Zeila, daughter of old Bhori, the tin-seller in the bazaar, to
Abdul, whose father is jemidar of chaprassies at the burra
bungalow.”</p>

<p>At the mere mention of marriage there came into the
mind of Ibn the full formula for any such in Hodeidah—for
had he not attended them in his time, not so magnificent
as this perhaps but marriages of sorts? From noon on all
the relatives and friends invited would begin to appear in
twos and threes in the makhdara, where all preparations
for the entertainment of the guests had no doubt been made.
Here for them to sit on in so rich a case as this (or so he
had heard in the rumored affairs of the rich), would be
long benches of stone or teak, and upon them beautiful carpets
and pillows. (In all the marriages he had been permitted
to attend these were borrowed for the occasion from
relatives or friends.) Madayeh, or water-bubbles, would be
ready, although those well enough placed in the affairs of
this world would prefer to bring their own, carried by a
servant. A lot of little chatties for the pipes would be on
hand, as well as a number of fire-pots, these latter outside
the makhdara with a dozen boys, fan in hand, ready to refill
for each guest his pipe with tobacco and fire on the first
call of “<em>Ya yi-yall!</em>” How well he remembered his services
as a pipe-filler on occasions of this kind in his youth, how
well his pleasure as guest or friend, relative even on one
occasion, in his earlier and more prosperous years and
before he had become an outcast, when his own pipe had
been filled. Oh, the music! the bowls of sweets! the hot
kishr, the armful of delicious khat, and before and after
those little cakes of wheat with butter and curds! When
the makhdara was full and all the guests had been solemnly
greeted by the father of the bride, as well as by the prospective
husband, khat would be distributed, and the pleasure
of chewing it begin. Ah! Yes, weddings were wonderful
and very well in their way indeed, provided one
came by anything through them.</p>

<p>Alas, here, as in the case of the market sales, his opportunities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
for attending the same with any profit to himself,
the privilege of sharing in the delights and comforts of the
same, were over. He had no money, no repute, not even
respect. Indeed the presence of a beggar such as he on an
occasion of this kind, and especially here in Hodeidah where
were many rich, would be resented, taken almost as an evil
omen. Not only the guests within but those poorer admirers
without, such as these who but now followed the camel,
would look upon his even so much as distant approach as
a vile intrusion, lawless, worthless dog that he was, come
to peek and pry and cast a shadow upon what would otherwise
be a happy occasion.</p>

<p>Yet he could not resist the desire to follow a portion of
the way, anyhow. The escorted khat looked too enticing.
Bismillah! There must be some one who would
throw him a leaf on so festal an occasion, surely! By a
slow and halting process therefore he came finally before the
gate of the residence, into which already the camel had disappeared.
Before it was the usual throng of those not so
vastly better than himself who had come to rejoice for a
purpose, and within, the sound of the tom-tom and voices
singing. Over the gate and out of the windows were
hung silken carpets and jasmine sprays, for old Bhori was
by no means poor in this world’s goods.</p>

<p>While recognizing a number who might have been
tolerant of him, Ibn Abdullah also realized rather painfully
that of the number of these who were most friendly, having
known him too long as a public beggar, there were few.</p>

<p>“What! Ne’er-do-well!” cried one who recognized him
as having been publicly bastinadoed on one occasion here
years before, when he had been younger and healthy enough
to be a vendor of tobacco, for adulterating his tobacco. “Do
you come here, too?” Then turning to another he called:
“Look who comes here—Ibn, the rich man! A friend of
the good Bhori, no doubt, mayhap a relative, or at least one
of his invited guests!”</p>

<p>“Ay-ee, a friend of the groom at least!” cried another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>“Or a brother or cousin of the bride!” chaffed still a
third.</p>

<p>“A rich and disappointed seeker after her hand!” declared
a fourth titteringly.</p>

<p>“He brings rich presents, as one can see!” proclaimed a
fifth. “But look now at his hands!” A chortle followed,
joined in by many.</p>

<p>“And would he be content with so little as a spray of
khat in return?” queried a sixth.</p>

<p>“By Allah, an honest tobacco-merchant! Bismillah!
One whom the Cadi loves!” cried a seventh.</p>

<p>For answer Ibn turned a solemn and craving eye upon
them, thinking only of khat. “Inshallah! Peace be with
thee, good citizens!” he returned. “Abuse not one who is
very low in his state. Alms! Alms! A little khat, of all
that will soon generously be bestowed upon thee! Alms!”</p>

<p>“Away, old robber!” cried one of them. “If you had
ever been honest you would not now be poor.”</p>

<p>“What, old jackal, dost thou come here to beg? What
brings thee from the steps of the mosque? Are the praying
faithful so ungenerous? By Allah! Likely they know
thee—not?”</p>

<p>“Peace! Peace! And mayst thou never know want and
distress such as mine! Food I have not had for three days.
My bones yearn for so much as a leaf of khat. Be thou
generous and of all that is within, when a portion is given
thee give me but a leaf!”</p>

<p>“The Cadi take thee!”</p>

<p>“Dog!”</p>

<p>“Beggar!”</p>

<p>“Come not too near, thou bag of decay!”</p>

<p>So they threatened him and he came no closer, removing
rather to a safe distance and eyeing as might a lorn jackal
a feast partaken of by lions.</p>

<p>Yet having disposed of this objectionable intruder in this
fashion, no khat was as yet forthcoming, the reason being
that it was not yet time. Inside, the wedding ceremony and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
feast, a matter of slow and ordered procedure, was going
forward with great care. Kishr was no doubt now being
drunk, and there were many felicitations to be extended
and received. But, once it was all over and the throng
without invited to partake of what was left, Ibn was not
one of those included. Rather, he was driven off with
curses by a servant, and being thus entirely shut out could
only wait patiently in the distance until those who had entered
should be satisfied and eventually come forth wiping
their lips and chewing khat—in better humor, perchance—or
go his way. Then, if he chose to stay, and they were
kind—</p>

<p>But, having eaten and drunk, they were in no better
mood in regard to him. As they came forth, singly or in
pairs, an hour or more later, they saw in him only a pest,
one who would take from them a little of that which they
themselves had earned with difficulty. Therefore they
passed him by unheeding or with jests.</p>

<p>And by now it was that time in the afternoon when the
effect on the happy possessor of khat throughout all Arabia
was only too plainly to be seen. The Arab servant who in
the morning had been surly and taciturn under the blazing
sun was now, with a wad of the vivifying leaves in his
cheek, doing his various errands and duties with a smile and
a light foot. The bale which the ordinary coolie of the
waterfront could not lift in the morning was now but a
featherweight on his back. The coffee merchant who in
the morning was acrid in manner and sharp at a bargain,
now received your orders gratefully and with a pleasantry,
and even a bid for conversation in his eye. Abdullah, the
silk merchant, dealing with his customers in sight of the
mosque, bestowed compliments and presents. By Allah, he
would buy your horse for the price of an elephant and find
no favor too great to do for you. Yussuf, the sambuk-carrier,
a three-hundred-weight goatskin on his back, and
passing Ibn near the mosque once more, assured Ali, his
familiar of the same world and of equal load, as they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
trudged along together, “Cut off my strong hand, and I
will become Hadji, the sweeper” (a despised caste), “but
take away my khat, and let me die!” Everywhere the
evasive, apathetic atmosphere of the morning had given way
to the valor of sentient life. Chewing the life-giving weed,
all were sure that they could perform prodigies of energy
and strength, that life was a delicious thing, the days and
years of their troubles as nothing.</p>

<p>But viewing this and having none, and trudging moodily
along toward his waiting-place in front of the mosque, Ibn
was truly depressed and out of sorts. The world was not
right. Age and poverty should command more respect.
To be sure, in his youth perhaps he had not been all that
he might have been, but still, for that matter, had many
others so been? Were not all men weak, after their kind,
or greedy or uncharitable? By Allah, they were, and as
he had reason to know! Waidi, the water-seller? A thief
really, no whit better than himself, if the world but knew.
Hussein, the peddler of firewood; Haifa, the tobacco tramp—a
wretched and swindling pack, all, not a decent loin- or
shoulder-cloth among them, possessed of no better places of
abode than his own really, yet all, even as the richest of
men, had their khat, could go to their coffee places this
night and enjoy it for a few anna. Even they! And he!</p>

<p>In Hodeidah there was still another class, the strictly
business or merchant class, who, unlike men of wealth or
the keepers of the very small shops, wound up their affairs
at four in the afternoon and returning to their homes made
a kind of public show of their ease and pleasure in khat from
then on until the evening prayers. Charpoys, water-pipes
and sweetmeats were brought forth into the shade before the
street door. The men of the household and their male
friends sprawled sociably on the charpoys, the ingredients
for the promotion of goodly fellowship ready to their hands.
A graybeard or two might sit among them expounding from
the sacred book, or conversation lively in character but subdued
in tone entertained the company. Then the aged, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
palsied, even the dying of the family, their nearest of kin,
were brought down on their beds from the top of the house
to partake of this feast of reason and flow of wit. Inside
the latticed windows the women sat, munching the second-best
leaves and listening to the scraps of wisdom that floated
up to them from the company below.</p>

<p>It was from this hour on that Ibn found it most difficult
to endure life. To see the world thus gay while he was
hungry was all but too much. After noting some of this
he wandered wearily down the winding market street which
led from the mosque to the waterfront, and where in view
of the sea were a few of the lowest coffee-houses, frequented
by coolies, bhisties and hadjis. Here in some one of them,
though without a single pice in his hand, he proposed to make
a final effort before night should fall, so that thereafter in
some one of them, the very lowest of course, he himself
might sit over the little khat he would (if fortunate) be
permitted to purchase, and a little kishr. Perhaps in one of
these he would receive largess from one of these lowest of
mabraz masters or his patrons, or be permitted to tell an
old and hoarse and quavering tale. His voice was indeed
wretched.</p>

<p>On his way thence, however, via the Street of the Seven
Blessings, he came once more before the door of Al Hajjaj,
the cook, busy among his pots and pans, and paused rather
disconsolately in the sight of the latter, who recognized
him but made no sign.</p>

<p>“Alms, O Hajjaj, in the name of the Prophet, and
mayst thou never look about thy shop but that it shall be
full of customers and thy profit large!” he voiced humbly.</p>

<p>“Be off! Hast thou no other door than mine before
which to pause and moan?”</p>

<p>“Ever generous Hajjaj,” he continued, “’tis true thou
hast been kind often, and I deserve nothing more of thee.
Yet wilt thou believe me that for days I have had neither
food nor drink—nor a leaf of khat—nay, not so much as
an wheaten cake, a bowl of curds or even a small cup of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
kishr. My state is low. That I shall not endure another
day I know.”</p>

<p>“And well enough, dog, since thou hast not made more
of thy life than thou hast. Other men have affairs and
children, but thou nothing. What of all thy years? Hast
thou aught to show? Thou knowest by what steps thou
hast come so. There are those as poor as thyself who can
sing in a coffee-house or tell a tale. But thou—Come,
canst thou think of nothing better than begging? Does not
Hussein, the beggar, sing? And Ay-eeb tell tales? Come!”</p>

<p>“Do thou but look upon me! Have I the strength? Or
a voice? Or a heart for singing? It is true; I have sung in
my time, but now my tales are known, and I have not the
strength to gather new ones. Yet who would listen?”</p>

<p>The restaurant-keeper eyed him askance. “Must I
therefore provide for thee daily? By Allah, I will not!
Here is a pice for thee. Be off, and come not soon again!
I do not want thee before my door. My customers will
not come here if thou dost!”</p>

<p>With slow and halting steps Ibn now took himself off,
but little the better for the small gift made him. There
was scarcely any place where for a pice, the smallest of
coins, he could obtain anything. What, after all, was to
be had for it—a cup of kishr? No. A small bowl of
curds? No. A sprig of khat? No. And so great was
his need, his distress of mind and body, that little less than a
good armful of khat, or at least a dozen or more green
succulent sprays, to be slowly munched and the juice allowed
to sharpen his brain and nerves, would have served to
strengthen and rest him. But how to come by so much
now? How?</p>

<p>The character of the places frequented by the coolies,
bhisties (water-carriers), hadjis and even beggars like Ibn,
while without any of the so-called luxuries of these others,
and to the frequenters of which the frequenters of these
were less than the dust under their feet, were still, to these
latter, excellent enough. Yea, despised as they were, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
contained charpoys on which each could sit with his little
water-chatty beside him, and in the centre of the circle one
such as even the lowly Ibn, a beggar, singing his loudest or
reciting some tale—for such as they. It was in such places
as these, before his voice had wholly deserted him, that
Ibn had told his tales. Here, then, for the price of a few
anna, they could munch the leavings of the khat market,
drink kishr and discuss the state of the world and their
respective fortunes. Compared to Ibn in his present state,
they were indeed as lords, even princes.</p>

<p>But, by Allah, although having been a carrier and a
vendor himself in his day, and although born above them,
yet having now no voice nor any tales worth the telling,
he was not even now looked upon as one who could stand
up and tell of the wonders of the Jinn and demons and the
great kings and queens who had reigned of old. Indeed, so
low had he fallen that he could not even interest this despised
caste. His only gift now was listening, or to make
a pathetic picture, or recite the ills that were his.</p>

<p>Nevertheless necessity, a stern master, compelled him to
think better of his quondam tale-telling art. Only, being,
as he knew, wholly unsuited to recite any tale now, he
also knew that the best he could do would be to make
the effort, a pretense, in the hope that those present,
realizing his age and unfitness, would spare him the spectacle
he would make of himself and give him a few anna
wherewith to ease himself then and there. Accordingly,
the hour having come when the proffered services of a
singer or story-teller would be welcomed in any mabraz,
he made his way to this region of many of them and where
beggars were so common. Only, glancing through the door
of the first one, he discovered that there were far too few
patrons for his mood. They would be in nowise gay, hence
neither kind nor generous as yet, and the keeper would be
cold. In a second, a little farther on, a tom-tom was beginning,
but the guests were only seven in number and but
newly settled in their pleasure. In a third, when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
diaphanous sky without was beginning to pale to a deep
steel and the evening star was hanging like a solitaire from
the pure breast of the western firmament, he pushed aside
the veiling cords of beads of one and entered, for here was
a large company resting upon their pillows and charpoys,
their chatties and hubbuks beside them, but no singer or
beater of a tom-tom or teller of tales as yet before
them.</p>

<p>“O friends,” he began with some diffidence and imaginings,
for well he knew how harsh were the moods and cynical
the judgments of some of these lowest of life’s offerings,
“be generous and hearken to the tale of one whose life has
been long and full of many unfortunate adventures, one
who although he is known to you—”</p>

<p>“What!” called Hussein, the peddler of firewood, reclining
at his ease in his corner, a spray of all but wilted
khat in his hand. “Is it not even Ibn Abdullah? And
has he turned tale-teller once more? By Allah, a great
teller of tales—one of rare voice! The camels and jackals
will be singing in Hodeidah next!”</p>

<p>“An my eyes deceive me not,” cried Waidi, the water-carrier,
at his ease also, a cup of kishr in his hands, “this
is not Ibn Abdullah, but Sindbad, fresh from a voyage!”</p>

<p>“Or Ali Baba himself,” cried Yussuf, the carrier, hoarsely.
“Thou hast a bag of jewels somewhere about thee? Now
indeed we shall hear things!”</p>

<p>“And in what a voice!” added Haifa the tobacco-tramp,
noting the husky, wheezy tones with which Ibn opened his
plea. “This is to be a treat, truly. And now we may rest
and have wonders upon wonders. Ibn of Mecca and
Jiddah, and even of marvelous Hodeidah itself, will now
tell us much. A cup of kishr, ho! This must be listened
to!”</p>

<p>But now Bab-al Oman, the keeper, a stout and cumbrous
soul, coming forth from his storeroom, gazed upon Ibn with
mingled astonishment and no little disfavor, for it was not
customary to permit any of his customers of the past to beg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
in here, and as for a singer or story-teller he had never
thought of Ibn in that light these many years. He was
too old, without the slightest power to do aught but begin
in a wheezy voice.</p>

<p>“Hearken,” he called, coming over and laying a hand
on him, the while the audience gazed and grinned, “hast
thou either anna or rupee wherewith to fulfill thy account
in case thou hast either khat or kishr?” The rags
and the mummy-like pallor of the old man offended
him.</p>

<p>“Do but let him speak,” insisted Hussein the peddler
gaily, “or sing,” for he was already feeling the effects
of his ease and the restorative power of the plant. “This
will be wonderful. By the voices of eleven hundred elephants!”</p>

<p>“Yea, a story,” called Waidi, “or perhaps that of the
good Cadi of Taiz and the sacred waters of Jezer!”</p>

<p>“Or of the Cadi of Mecca and the tobacco that was too
pure!”</p>

<p>Ibn heard full well and knew the spectacle he was making
of himself. The references were all too plain. Only
age and want and a depressing feebleness, which had been
growing for days, caused him to forget, or prevented, rather,
his generating a natural rage and replying in kind. These
wretched enemies of his, dogs lower than himself, had
never forgiven him that he had been born out of their
caste, or, having been so, that he had permitted himself
to sink to labor and beg with them. But now his age and
weakness were too great. He was too weary to contend.</p>

<p>“O most generous Oman, best of keepers of a mabraz—and
thou, O comfortable and honorable guests,” he insisted
wheezily, “I have here but one pice, the reward of all
my seekings this day. It is true that I am a beggar and
that my coverings are rags, yet do but consider that I am
old and feeble. This day and the day before and the day
before that—”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” said Oman restlessly and feeling that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the custom and trade of his mabraz were being injured,
“out! Thou canst not sing and thou canst not tell a tale,
as thou well knowest. Why come here when thou hast but
a single pice wherewith to pay thy way? Beg more, but
not here! Bring but so much as half a rupee, and thou
shalt have service in plenty!”</p>

<p>“But the pice I have here—may not I—O good sons of
the Prophet, a spray of khat, a cup of kishr—suffer me not
thus be cast forth! ‘—and the poor and the son of the
road!’ Alms—alms—in the name of Allah!”</p>

<p>“Out, out!” insisted Oman gently but firmly. “So much
as ten anna, and thou mayst rest here; not otherwise.”</p>

<p>He turned him forth into the night.</p>

<p>And now, weak and fumbling, Ibn stood there for a time,
wondering where else to turn. He was so weak that at last
even the zest for search or to satisfy himself was departing.
For a moment, a part of his old rage and courage returning,
he threw away the pice that had been given him, then
turned back, but not along the street of the bazaars. He
was too distrait and disconsolate. Rather, by a path which
he well knew, he circled now to the south of the town,
passing via the Bet-el-Fakin gate to the desert beyond the
walls, where, ever since his days as a pack servant with the
Bedouins, he had thought to come in such an hour. Overhead
were the stars in that glorious æther, lit with a light
which never shines on other soils or seas. The evening
star had disappeared, but the moon was now in the west,
a thin feather, yet transfiguring and transforming as by
magic the homely and bare features of the sands. Out here
was something of that beauty which as a herdsman among
the Bedouins he had known, the scent of camels and of
goats’ milk, the memory of low black woolen tents, dotting
the lion-tawny sands and gazelle-brown gravels with
a warm and human note, and the camp-fire that, like a
glowworm, had denoted the village centre. Now, as in a
dream, the wild weird songs of the boys and girls of the
desert came back, the bleating of their sheep and goats in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
the gloaming. And the measured chant of the spearsmen,
gravely stalking behind their charges, the camels, their song
mingling with the bellowing of their humpy herds.</p>

<p>“It is finished,” he said, once he was free of the city and
far into the desert itself. “I have no more either the
skill nor the strength wherewith to endure or make my
way. And without khat one cannot endure. What will be
will be, and I am too old. Let them find me so. I shall
not move. It is better than the other.”</p>

<p>Then upon the dry, warm sands he laid himself, his
head toward Mecca, while overhead the reremouse circled
and cried, its tiny shriek acknowledging its zest for life;
and the rave of a jackal, resounding through the illuminated
shade beyond, bespoke its desire to live also. Most musical
of all music, the palm trees now answered the whispers
of the night breeze with the softest tones of falling water.</p>

<p>“It is done,” sighed Ibn Abdullah, as he lay and wearily
rested. “Worthless I came, O Allah, and worthless I return.
It is well.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VII">VII<br>
TYPHOON</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Into</span> a singularly restricted and indifferent environment
Ida Zobel was born. Her mother, a severe, prim German
woman, died when she was only three, leaving her to the
care of her father and his sister, both extremely reserved and
orderly persons. Later, after Ida had reached the age of ten,
William Zobel took unto himself a second wife, who resembled
Zobel and his first wife in their respect for labor and
order.</p>

<p>Both were at odds with the brash gayety and looseness
of the American world in which they found themselves.
Being narrow, sober, workaday Germans, they were annoyed
by the groups of restless, seeking, eager, and as Zobel saw it,
rather scandalous young men and women who paraded the
neighborhood streets of an evening without a single thought
apparently other than pleasure. And these young scamps
and their girl friends who sped about in automobiles. The
loose, indifferent parents. The loose, free ways of all these
children. What was to become of such a nation? Were
not the daily newspapers, which he would scarcely tolerate
in his home longer, full of these wretched doings? The
pictures of almost naked women that filled them all! Jazz!
Petting parties! High school boys with flasks on their hips!
Girls with skirts to their knees, rolled-down stockings, rolled-down
neck-bands, bare arms, bobbed hair, no decent concealing
underwear!</p>

<p>“What—a daughter of his grow up like that! Be permitted
to join in this prancing route to perdition! Never!”
And in consequence, the strictest of rules with regard to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
Ida’s upbringing. Her hair was to grow its natural length,
of course. Her lips and cheeks were never to know the blush
of false, suggestive paint. Plain dresses. Plain underwear
and stockings and shoes and hats. No crazy, idiotic finery,
but substantial, respectable clothing. Work at home and,
when not otherwise employed with her studies at school, in
the small paint and color store which her father owned in
the immediate vicinity of their home. And last, but not
least, a schooling of such proper and definite character as
would serve to keep her mind from the innumerable current
follies which were apparently pulling at the foundations of
decent society.</p>

<p>For this purpose Zobel chose a private and somewhat
religious school conducted by an aged German spinster of
the name of Elizabeth Hohstauffer, who had succeeded after
years and years of teaching in impressing her merits as a
mentor on perhaps as many as a hundred German families
of the area. No contact with the careless and shameless
public school here. And once the child had been inducted
into that, there followed a series of daily inquiries and
directions intended to guide her in the path she was to
follow.</p>

<p>“Hurry! You have only ten minutes now in which to
get to school. There is no time to lose!”... “How comes
it that you are five minutes late to-night? What were you
doing?”... “Your teacher made you stay? You had
to stop and look for a blank book?”... “Why didn’t
you come home first and let me look for it with you afterwards?”
(It was her stepmother talking.) “You know your
father doesn’t want you to stay after school.”... “And
just what were you doing on Warren Avenue between twelve
and one to-day? Your father said you were with some
girl.”... “Vilma Balet? And who is Vilma Balet?
Where does she live? And how long has it been that you
have been going with her? Why is it that you have not
mentioned her before? You know what your father’s rule
is. And now I shall have to tell him. He will be angry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
You must obey his rules. You are by no means old enough
to decide for yourself. You have heard him say that.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, Ida, though none too daring or
aggressive mentally, was being imaginatively drawn to the
very gayeties and pleasures that require courage and daring.
She lived in a mental world made up of the bright lights of
Warren Avenue, of which she caught an occasional glimpse.
The numerous cars speeding by! The movies and her
favorite photographs of actors and actresses, some of the mannerisms
of whom the girls imitated at school. The voices,
the laughter of the boys and girls as they walked to and fro
along the commonplace thoroughfare with its street-cars
and endless stores side by side! And what triumphs or prospective
joys they planned and palavered over as they strolled
along in their easy manner—arms linked and bodies swaying—up
the street and around the corner and back into the
main street again, gazing at their graceful ankles and bodies
in the mirrors and windows as they passed, or casting shy
glances at the boys.</p>

<p>But as for Ida—despite her budding sensitivity—at ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen—there was no escape from
the severe regimen she was compelled to follow. Breakfast
at seven-thirty sharp because the store had to be opened by
her father at eight; luncheon at twelve-thirty, on the dot to
satisfy her father; dinner invariably at six-thirty, because
there were many things commercial and social which fell
upon the shoulders of William Zobel at night. And between
whiles, from four to six on weekdays and later from seven
to ten at night, as well as all day Saturdays, store duty in
her father’s store. No parties, no welcome home atmosphere
for the friends of her choice. Those she really liked were
always picked to pieces by her stepmother, and of course this
somewhat influenced the opinion of her father. It was common
gossip of the neighborhood that her parents were very
strict and that they permitted her scarcely any liberties. A
trip to a movie, the choice of which was properly supervised
by her parents; an occasional ride in an automobile with her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
parents, since by the time she had attained her fifteenth year
he had purchased one of the cheaper cars.</p>

<p>But all the time the rout of youthful life before her
eyes. And in so far as her home life and the emotional
significance of her parents were concerned, a sort of depressing
grayness. For William Zobel, with his gray-blue eyes
gleaming behind gilt-rimmed glasses, was scarcely the person
to whom a girl of Ida’s temperament would be drawn. Nor
was her stepmother, with her long, narrow face, brown eyes
and black hair. Indeed, Zobel was a father who by the very
solemnity of his demeanor, as well as the soberness and practicability
of his thoughts and rules, was constantly evoking a
sense of dictatorship which was by no means conducive to
sympathetic approach. To be sure, there were greetings,
acknowledgments, respectful and careful explanations as to
this, that and the other. Occasionally they would go to a
friend’s house or a public restaurant, but there existed no
understanding on the part of either Zobel or his wife—he
never having wanted a daughter of his own and she not
being particularly drawn to the child of another—of the
growing problems of adolescence that might be confronting
her, and hence none of that possible harmony and enlightenment
which might have endeared each to the other.</p>

<p>Instead, repression, and even fear at times, which in the
course of years took on an aspect of careful courtesy supplemented
by accurate obedience. But within herself a growing
sense of her own increasing charm, which, in her father’s
eyes, if not in her stepmother’s, seemed to be identified always
with danger—either present or prospective. Her very
light and silky hair—light, grayish-blue eyes—a rounded and
intriguing figure which even the other girls at Miss Hohstauffer’s
school noticed and commented on. And in addition
a small straight nose and a full and yet small and almost
pouting mouth and rounded chin. Had she not a mirror
and were there not boys from her seventh year on who
looked at her and sought to attract her attention? Her
father could see this as well as his second wife. But she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
dared not loiter here and there as others did, for those
vigorous, bantering, seeking, intriguing contacts. She must
hurry home—to store or house duty or more study in such
fields as Zobel and his wife thought best for her. If it was
to run errands she was always timed to the minute.</p>

<p>And yet, in spite of all these precautions, the swift telegraphy
of eyes and blood. The haunting, seeking moods of
youth, which speaks a language of its own. In the drugstore
at the corner of Warren and Tracy, but a half-block
from her home, there was at one time in her twelfth year
Lawrence Sullivan, a soda clerk. He seemed to her the most
beautiful thing she had ever seen. The dark, smooth hair
lying glossed and parted above a perfect white forehead;
slim, graceful hands—or so she thought—a care and smartness
in the matter of dress which even the clothing of the
scores of public school boys passing this way seemed scarcely
to match. And such a way where girls were concerned—so
smiling and at his ease. And always a word for them as they
stopped in on their way home from school.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Della! How’s Miss McGinnis to-day? I
bet I know what you’re going to have. I think pretty blonde
girls must like chocolate sundaes—they contrast with their
complexions.” And then smiling serenely while Miss McGinnis
panted and smiled: “A lot you know about what
blonde girls like.”</p>

<p>And Ida Zobel, present on occasion by permission for a
soda or a sundae, looking on and listening most eagerly.
Such a handsome youth. All of sixteen. He would as yet
pay no attention to so young a girl as she, of course, but
when she was older! Would she be as pretty as this Miss
McGinnis? Could she be as assured? How wonderful to
be attractive to such a youth! And what would he say to
her, if he said anything at all? And what would she say in
return? Many times she imitated these girls mentally and
held imaginary conversations with herself. Yes, despite this
passive admiration, Mr. Sullivan went the way of all soda-clerks,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
changing eventually to another job in another neighborhood.</p>

<p>But in the course of time there were others who took her
eye and for a time held her mind—around whose differing
charms she erected fancies which had nothing to do with
reality. One of these was Merton Webster, the brisk, showy,
vain and none too ambitious son of a local state senator,
who lived in the same block she did and attended Watkins
High School, which she was not permitted to attend. So
handsome was he—so debonair. “Hello, kid! Gee, you
look cute, all right. One of these days I’ll take you to a
dance if you want to go.” Yet, because of her years and the
strict family espionage, blushes, her head down, but a smile
none the less.</p>

<p>And she was troubled by thoughts of him until Walter
Stour, whose father conducted a realty and insurance business
only a little way west of her father’s store, took her
attention—a year later. Walter was a tall, fair complexioned
youth, with gay eyes and a big, laughing mouth, who,
occasionally with Merton Webster, Lawrence Cross, a grocer’s
son, Sven Volberg, the dry-cleaner’s son, and some
others, hung about the favorite moving-picture theatre or
the drugstore on the main corner and flirted with the girls
as they passed by. As restricted as she was still, because of
her trips to and fro between home and school and her service
as a clerk in her father’s store, she was not unfamiliar with
these several figures or their names. They came into the
store occasionally and even commented on her looks: “Oh,
getting to be a pretty girl, isn’t she?” Whereupon she
would flush with excitement and nervously busy herself about
filling a customer’s order.</p>

<p>It was through Etelka Shomel, the daughter of a German
neighbor who was also a friend of William Zobel, that she
learned much of these boys and girls. Her father thought
Etelka a safe character for Ida to chum with, chiefly on
account of her unattractiveness. But through her, as well as
their joint pilgrimages here and there, she came to hear much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
gossip about the doings of these same. Walter Stour,
whom she now greatly admired, was going with a
girl by the name of Edna Strong, who was the daughter
of a milk-dealer. Stour’s father was not as stingy as
some fathers. He had a good car and occasionally let
his son use it. Stour often took Edna and some of her
friends to boathouse resorts on the Little Shark River.
A girl friend of Etelka’s told her what a wonderful mimic
and dancer he was. She had been on a party with him.
And, of course, Ida lent a willing and eager ear to all this.
Oh, the gayety of such a life! Its wonders! Beauties!</p>

<p>And then one night, as Ida was coming around the corner
to go to her father’s store at about seven-thirty and
Stour was on his favorite corner with several other boys,
he called: “I know who’s a sweet kid, but her daddy
won’t let her look at a guy. Will he?” This last aimed
directly at her as she passed, while she, knowing full well
who was meant and how true it was, hurried on all the
faster. If her father had heard that! Oh, my! But it
thrilled her as she walked. “Sweet kid.” “Sweet kid”—kept
ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>And then at last, in her sixteenth year, Edward Hauptwanger
moved into a large house in Grey Street. His father,
Jacob Hauptwanger, was a well-to-do coal-dealer who had
recently purchased a yard on the Absecon. It was about
this time that Ida became keenly aware that her normal
girlhood, with its so necessary social contacts, was being set
at naught and that she was being completely frustrated by
the stern and repressive attitude of her father and stepmother.
The wonder and pain, for instance, of spring and
summer evenings just then, when she would stand gazing at
the moon above her own commonplace home—shining down
into the narrow, commonplace garden at the back, where
still were tulips, hyacinths, honeysuckle and roses. And the
stars shining above Warren Avenue, where were the cars,
the crowds, the moving-picture theatres and restaurants
which held such charm for her. There was a kind of madness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
an ache, in it all. Oh, for pleasure—pleasure! To
go, run, dance, play, kiss with some one—almost any one,
really, if he were only young and handsome. Was she
going to know no one—no one? And, worse, the young
men of the neighborhood calling to her as she passed: “Oh,
look who’s here! Shame her daddy won’t let her out.”
“Why don’t you bob your hair, Ida? You’d be cute.”
Even though she was out of school now, she was clerking
as before and dressing as before. No short skirts, bobbed
hair, rolled-down stockings, rouge.</p>

<p>But with the arrival of this Edward Hauptwanger, there
came a change. For here was a youth of definite and
drastic impulses—a beau, a fighter, a fellow of infinite
guile where girls of all sorts were concerned—and, too, a
youth of taste in the matter of dress and manner—one who
stood out as a kind of hero to the type of youthful male
companions with whom he chose to associate. Did he not
live in a really large, separate house on Grey Street? And
were not his father’s coal-pockets and trucks conspicuously
labelled outstanding features of the district? And, in addition,
Hauptwanger, owing to the foolish and doting
favor of his mother (by no means shared by his father),
always supplied with pocket money sufficient to meet
all required expenditures of such a world as this. The
shows to which he could take his “flames”; the restaurants,
downtown as well as here. And the boat club on the Little
Shark which at once became a rendezvous of his. He had
a canoe of his own, so it was said. He was an expert
swimmer and diver. He was allowed the use of his
father’s car and would often gather up his friends on a
Saturday or Sunday and go to the boat club.</p>

<p>More interesting still, after nearly a year’s residence here,
in which he had had time to establish himself socially after
this fashion, he had his first sight of Ida Zobel passing one
evening from her home to the store. Her youthful if repressed
beauty was at its zenith. And some remarks concerning
her and her restricted life by youths who had neither<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
the skill nor the daring to invade it at once set him thinking.
She was beautiful, you bet! Hauptwanger, because of
a certain adventurous fighting strain in his blood, was at
once intrigued by the difficulties which thus so definitely
set this girl apart. “These old-fashioned, dictatorial Germans!
And not a fellow in the neighborhood to step up
and do anything about it! Well, whaddya know?”</p>

<p>And forthwith an intensive study of the situation as well
as of the sensitive, alluring Ida Zobel. And with the result
that he was soon finding himself irresistibly attracted
to her. That pretty face! That graceful, rounded figure!
Those large, blue-gray, shy and evasive eyes! Yet with
yearning in them, too.</p>

<p>And in consequence various brazen parades past the very
paint store of Zobel, with the fair Ida within. And this
despite the fact that Zobel himself was there—morning,
noon and night—bent over his cash register or his books
or doing up something for a customer. And Ida, by reason
of her repressed desires and sudden strong consciousness of
his interest in her as thus expressed, more and more attracted
to him. And he, because of this or his own interest, coming
to note the hours when she was most likely to be alone.
These were, as a rule, Wednesdays and Fridays, when
because of a singing society as well as a German social and
commercial club her father was absent from eight-thirty on.
And although occasionally assisted by her stepmother she was
there alone on these nights.</p>

<p>And so a campaign which was to break the spell which
held the sleeping beauty. At first, however, only a smile
in the direction of Ida whenever he passed or she passed
him, together with boasts to his friends to the effect that
he would “win that kid yet, wait and see.” And then, one
evening, in the absence of Zobel, a visit to the store. She
was behind the counter and between the business of waiting
on customers was dreaming as usual of the life outside.
For during the past few weeks she had become most sharply
conscious of the smiling interest of Hauptwanger. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
straight, lithe body—his quick, aggressive manner—his assertive,
seeking eyes! Oh, my! Like the others who had
gone before him and who had attracted her emotional interest,
he was exactly of that fastidious, self-assured and
self-admiring type toward which one so shy as herself
would yearn. No hesitancy on his part. Even for this
occasion he had scarcely troubled to think of a story. What
difference? Any old story would do. He wanted to see
some paints. They might be going to repaint the house
soon—and in the meantime he could engage her in conversation,
and if the “old man” came back, well, he would talk
paints to him.</p>

<p>And so, on this particularly warm and enticing night
in May, he walked briskly in, a new gray suit, light tan
fedora hat and tan shoes and tie completing an ensemble
which won the admiration of the neighborhood. “Oh,
hello. Pretty tough to have to work inside on a night like
this, ain’t it?” (A most irresistible smile going with this.)
“I want to see some paints—the colors of ’em, I mean.
The old man is thinking of repainting the house.”</p>

<p>And at once Ida, excited and flushing to the roots of her
hair, turning to look for a color card—as much to conceal
her flushing face as anything else. And yet intrigued as
much as she was affrighted. The daring of him! Suppose
her father should return—or her stepmother enter? Still,
wasn’t he as much of a customer as any one else—although
she well knew by his manner that it was not paint that had
brought him. For over the way, as she herself could and
did see, were three of his admiring companions ranged in
a row to watch him, the while he leaned genially and
familiarly against the counter and continued: “Gee, I’ve
seen you often enough, going back and forth between your
school and this store and your home. I’ve been around
here nearly a year now, but I’ve never seen you around
much with the rest of the girls. Too bad! Otherwise
we mighta met. I’ve met all the rest of ’em so far,” and
at the same time by troubling to touch his tie he managed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
to bring into action one hand on which was an opal ring,
his wrist smartly framed in a striped pink cuff. “I heard
your father wouldn’t even let you go to Warren High.
Pretty strict, eh?” And he beamed into the blue-gray eyes
of the budding girl before him, noted the rounded pink
cheeks, the full mouth, the silky hair, the while she trembled
and thrilled.</p>

<p>“Yes, he is pretty strict.”</p>

<p>“Still, you can’t just go nowhere all the time, can you?”
And by now the color card, taken into his own hand, was
lying flat on the counter. “You gotta have a little fun
once in a while, eh? If I’da thought you’da stood for it,
I’da introduced myself before this. My father has the big
coal-dock down here on the river. He knows your father,
I’m sure. I gotta car, or at least my dad has, and that’s as
good as mine. Do you think your father’d letcha take a
run out in the country some Saturday or Sunday—down to
Little Shark River, say, or Peck’s Beach? Lots of the
fellows and girls from around here go down there.”</p>

<p>By now it was obvious that Hauptwanger was achieving a
conquest of sorts and his companions over the way were
abandoning their advantageous position, no longer hopefully
interested by the possibility of defeat. But the nervous Ida,
intrigued though terrified, was thinking how wonderful it
was to at last interest so handsome a youth as this. Even
though her father might not approve, still might not all
that be overcome by such a gallant as this? But her hair
was not bobbed, her skirts not short, her lips not rouged.
Could it really be that he was attracted by her physical
charms? His dark brown and yet hard and eager eyes—his
handsome hands. The smart way in which he dressed.
She was becoming conscious of her severely plain blue dress
with white trimmings, her unmodish slippers and stockings.
At the same time she found herself most definitely replying:
“Oh, now, I couldn’t ever do anything like that, you
know. You see, my father doesn’t know you. He wouldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
let me go with any one he doesn’t know or to whom I haven’t
been properly introduced. You know how it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, couldn’t I introduce myself then? My father
knows your father, I’m sure. I could just tell him that I
want to call on you, couldn’t I? I’m not afraid of him,
and there’s sure no harm in that, is there?”</p>

<p>“Well, that might be all right, only he’s very strict—and
he might not want me to go, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw! But you would like to go, wouldn’t you?
Or to a picture show? He couldn’t kick against that, could
he?”</p>

<p>He looked her in the eye, smiling, and in doing so drew
the lids of his own eyes together in a sensuous, intriguing
way which he had found effective with others. And in the
budding Ida were born impulses of which she had no consciousness
and over which she had no control. She merely
looked at him weakly. The wonder of him! The beauty
of love! Her desire toward him! And so finding heart
to say: “No, maybe not. I don’t know. You see I’ve
never had a beau yet.”</p>

<p>She looked at him in such a way as to convince him of
his conquest. “Easy! A cinch!” was his thought. “Nothing
to it at all.” He would see Zobel and get his permission
or meet her clandestinely. Gee, a father like that had no
right to keep his daughter from having any fun at all.
These narrow, hard-boiled German parents—they ought to
be shown—awakened—made to come to life.</p>

<p>And so, within two days brazenly presenting himself to
Zobel in his store in order to test whether he could not
induce him to accept him as presumably at least a candidate
for his daughter’s favor. Supposing the affair did not
prove as appealing as he thought, he could drop the contact,
couldn’t he? Hadn’t he dropped others? Zobel knew of
his father, of course. And while listening to Hauptwanger’s
brisk and confident explanation he was quite consciously
evaluating the smart suit, new tan shoes and gathering, all
in all, a favorable impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“You say you spoke to her already?”</p>

<p>“I asked her if I might call on her, yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Uh-uh! When was this?”</p>

<p>“Just two days ago. In the evening here.”</p>

<p>“Uh-uh!”</p>

<p>At the same time a certain nervous, critical attitude toward
everything, which had produced many fine lines about
the eyes and above the nose of Mr. Zobel, again taking hold
of him: “Well, well—this is something I will have to
talk over with my daughter. I must see about this. I am
very careful of my daughter and who she goes with, you
know.” Nevertheless, he was thinking of the many coal
trucks delivering coal in the neighborhood, the German
name of this youth and his probable German and hence
conservative upbringing. “I will let you know about it
later. You come in some other time.”</p>

<p>And so later a conference with his daughter, resulting
finally in the conclusion that it might be advisable for her
to have at least one male contact. For she was sixteen
years old and up to the present time he had been pretty strict
with her. Perhaps she was over the worst period. At
any rate, most other girls of her age were permitted to go
out some. At least one beau of the right kind might be
essential, and somehow he liked this youth who had approached
him in this frank, fearless manner.</p>

<p>And so, for the time being, a call permitted once or
twice a week, with Hauptwanger from the first dreaming
most daring and aggressive dreams. And after a time,
having conducted himself most circumspectly, it followed
that an evening at one of the neighborhood picture houses
was suggested and achieved. And once this was accomplished
it became a regularity for him to spend either
Wednesday or Friday evening with Ida, it depending on her
work in the store. Later, his courage and skill never deserting
him, a suggestion to Mr. Zobel that he permit Ida
to go out with him on a Saturday afternoon to visit Peck’s
Beach nine miles below the city, on the Little Shark. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
was very nice there, and a popular Saturday and Sunday
resort for most of the residents of this area. After a time,
having by degrees gained the complete confidence of Zobel,
he was granted permission to take Ida to one or another
of the theatres downtown, or to a restaurant, or to the
house of a boy friend who had a sister and who lived in the
next block.</p>

<p>Despite his stern, infiltrating supervision, Zobel could
not prevent the progressive familiarities based on youth, desire,
romance. For with Edward Hauptwanger, to contact
was to intrigue and eventually demand and compel. And
so by degrees hand pressures, stolen or enforced kisses. Yet,
none the less, Ida, still fully dominated by the mood and
conviction of her father, persisting in a nervous evasiveness
which was all too trying to her lover.</p>

<p>“Ah, you don’t know my father. No, I couldn’t do that.
No, I can’t stay out so late. Oh, no—I wouldn’t dare go
there—I wouldn’t dare to. I don’t know what he would
do to me.”</p>

<p>This, or such as this, to all of his overtures which hinted
at later hours, a trip to that mysterious and fascinating
boat club on the Little Shark twenty-five miles out, where,
as he so glibly explained, were to be enjoyed dancing, swimming,
boating, music, feasting. But as Ida who had never
done any of these things soon discovered for herself, this
would require an unheard-of period of time—from noon
until midnight—or later Saturday, whereas her father had
fixed the hour of eleven-thirty for her return to the parental
roof.</p>

<p>“Ah, don’t you want to have any fun at all? Gee! He
don’t want you to do a thing and you let him get away with
it. Look at all the other girls and fellows around here.
There’s not one that’s as scary as you are. Besides, what
harm is there? Supposing we don’t get back on time?
Couldn’t we say the car broke down? He couldn’t say
anything to that. Besides, no one punches a time clock any
more.” But Ida nervous and still resisting, and Hauptwanger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
because of this very resistance, determined to win
her to his mood and to outwit her father at the same
time.</p>

<p>And then the lure of summer nights—Corybantic—dithyrambic—with
kisses, kisses, kisses—under the shadow of the
trees in King Lake Park, or in one of the little boats of its
lake which nosed the roots of those same trees on the shore.
And with the sensitive and sensual, and yet restricted and
inexperienced Ida, growing more and more lost in the spell
which youth, summer, love, had generated. The beauty of
the face of this, her grand cavalier! His clothes, his brisk,
athletic energy and daring! And with him perpetually
twittering of this and that, here and there, that if she only
truly loved him and had the nerve, what wouldn’t they do?
All the pleasures of the world before them, really. And then
at last, on this same lake—with her lying in his arms—himself
attempting familiarities which scarcely seemed possible
in her dreams before this, and which caused her to
jump up and demand to be put ashore, the while he merely
laughed.</p>

<p>“Oh, what had he done that was so terrible? Say, did
she really care for him? Didn’t she? Then, why so
uppish? Why cry? Oh, gee, this was a scream, this was.
Oh, all right, if that was the way she was going to feel
about it.” And once ashore, walking briskly off in the
gayest and most self-sufficient manner while she, alone and
tortured by her sudden ejection from paradise, slipped home
and into her room, there to bury her face in her pillow and
to whisper to it and herself of the danger—almost the
horror—that had befallen her. Yet in her eyes and mind
the while the perfect Hauptwanger. And in her heart his
face, hands, hair. His daring. His kisses. And so brooding
even here and now as to the wisdom of her course—her
anger—and in a dreary and hopeless mood even, dragging
herself to her father’s store the next day, merely to
wait and dream that he was not as evil as he had seemed—that
he could not have seriously contemplated the familiarities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
that he had attempted; that he had been merely obsessed,
bewitched, as she herself had been.</p>

<p>Oh, love, love! Edward! Edward! Edward! Oh, he
would not, could not remain away. She must see him—give
him a chance to explain. She must make him understand
that it was not want of love but fear of life—her
father, everything, everybody—that kept her so sensitive,
aloof, remote.</p>

<p>And Hauptwanger himself, for all of his bravado and
craft, now nervous lest he had been too hasty. For, after
all, what a beauty! The lure! He couldn’t let her go this
way. It was a little too delicious and wonderful to have her
so infatuated—and with a little more attention, who knew?
And so conspicuously placing himself where she must pass
on her way home in the evening, at the corner of Warren
and High—yet with no sign on his part of seeing her. And
Ida, with yearning and white-faced misery, seeing him as
she passed. Monday night! Tuesday night! And worse,
to see him pass the store early Wednesday evening without
so much as turning his head. And then the next day a note
handed the negro errand boy of her father’s store to be given
to him later, about seven, at the corner where he would
most surely be.</p>

<p>And then later, with the same Edward taking it most
casually and grandly and reading it. So she had been compelled
to write him, had she? Oh, these dames! Yet
with a definite thrill from the contents for all of that,
for it read: “Oh, Edward, darling, you can’t be so cruel
to me. How can you? I love you so. You didn’t mean
what you said. Tell me you didn’t. I didn’t. Oh, please
come to the house at eight. I want to see you.”</p>

<p>And Edward Hauptwanger, quite triumphant now, saying
to the messenger before four cronies who knew of his present
pursuit of Ida: “Oh, that’s all right. Just tell her I’ll
be over after a while.” And then as eight o’clock neared,
ambling off in the direction of the Zobel home. And as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
left one of his companions remarking: “Say, whaddya
know? He’s got that Zobel girl on the run now. She’s
writing him notes now. Didn’t ya see the coon bring it up?
Don’t it beat hell?” And the others as enviously, amazedly
and contemptuously inquiring: “Whaddya know?”</p>

<p>And so, under June trees in King Lake Park, once more
another conference. “Oh, darling, how could you treat me
so, how could you? Oh, my dear, dear darling.” And he
replying—“Oh, sure, sure, it was all right, only what do you
think I’m made of? Say, have a heart, I’m human, ain’t I?
I’ve got some feelings same as anybody else. Ain’t I crazy
about you and ain’t you crazy about me? Well, then—besides—well,
say....” A long pharisaical and deluding
argument as one might guess, with all the miseries and
difficulties of restrained and evaded desire most artfully
suggested—yet with no harm meant, of course. Oh, no.</p>

<p>But again, on her part, the old foolish, terrorized love plea.
And the firm assurance on his part that if anything went
wrong—why, of course. But why worry about that now?
Gee, she was the only girl he knew who worried about anything
like that. And finally a rendezvous at Little Shark
River, with his father’s car as the conveyance. And later
others and others. And she—because of her weak, fearsome
yielding in the first instance—and then her terrorized contemplation
of possible consequences in the second—clinging to
him in all too eager and hence cloying fashion. She was his
now—all his. Oh, he would never, never desert her, now,
would he?</p>

<p>But he, once satisfied—his restless and overweening ego
comforted by another victory—turning with a hectic and
chronic, and for him uncontrollable sense of satiety, as well
as fear of complications and burden—to other phases of
beauty—other fields and relationships where there was no
such danger. For after all—one more girl. One more
experience. And not so greatly different from others that
had gone before it. And this in the face of the magic of
her meaning before capitulation. He did not understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
it. He could not. He did not even trouble to think about
it much. But so it was. And with no present consciousness
or fear of being involved in any early and unsatisfactory
complications which might require marriage—on the contrary
a distinct and definite opposition to any such complication
at any time, anywhere.</p>

<p>Yet, at last, after many, many perfect hours throughout
July and August, the fatal complaint. There was something
wrong, she feared. She had such strange moods—such
strange spells, pains, fears—recently. Could there be?
Did he think there could be any danger? She had done
what he said. Oh, if there was! What was she to do
then? Would he marry her? He must, really, then.
There was no other way. Her father—his fierce anger.
Her own terrors. She could not live at home any more.
Could they not—would they not—be married now if anything
were wrong? He had said he would if anything
like this ever happened, had he not?</p>

<p>And Hauptwanger, in the face of this, suffering a nervous
and cold reaction. Marriage! The mere thought of such
a thing! Impossible! His father! His hitherto free roving
life! His future! Besides, how did she know? How
could she be sure? And supposing she was! Other girls
got out of such things without much trouble. Why not
she? And had he not taken all the usual customary and
necessary precautions that he knew! She was too easily
frightened—too uninformed—not daring enough. He knew
of lots of cases where girls got through situations of this
kind with ease. He would see about something first.</p>

<p>But conjoined with this, as she herself could see and
feel, a sudden definite coolness never before sensed or witnessed
by her, which was based on his firm determination
not to pursue this threatening relationship any longer,
seeing that to do so meant only to emphasize responsibility.
And in addition, a keen desire to stay away. Were there
not other girls? A whole world full. And only recently
had he not been intrigued by one who was more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
aware of the free, smart ways of pleasure and not so likely
ever to prove a burden?</p>

<p>But on the other hand, in the face of a father as strict
as Zobel himself and a mother who believed in his goodness,
his course was not absolutely clear either. And so
from this hour on an attempt to extricate himself as speedily
and as gracefully as possible from this threatening position.
But before this a serious, if irritated, effort on his part to
find a remedy among his friends of the boating club and
street corners. But with the result merely of a vivid
advertisement of the fact that this gay and successful adventure
of his had now resulted most unsuccessfully for
Ida. And thereafter hints and nods and nudges among
themselves whenever she chanced to pass. And Ida, because
of fear of scandal, staying in as much as she could
these days, or when she did appear trying to avoid Warren
Avenue at High as much as possible. For by now she was
truly terrified, seized indeed with the most weakening emotions
based on the stern and unrelenting countenance of
her father which loomed so threateningly beyond the immediate
future. “If me no ifs,” and “but me no buts.” Oh,
how to do? For throughout the trial of this useless remedy,
there had been nothing to do but wait. And the waiting
ended in nothing—only greater horrors. And between all
this, and enforced work at the store and enforced duties
at home, efforts to see her beloved—who, because of new
and more urgent duties, was finding it harder and harder to
meet her anywhere or at any time.</p>

<p>“But you must see how it is with me, don’t you, dear?
I can’t go on like this, can’t you see that? You said you’d
marry me, didn’t you? And look at all the time that’s
gone already. Oh, I’m almost mad. You must do something.
You must! You must! If father should find out,
what in the world would I do? What would he do to
me, and to you, too? Can’t you see how bad it is?”</p>

<p>Yet in the face of this tortured plea on the part of this
frantic and still love-sick girl, a calm on the part of Hauptwanger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
that expressed not indifference but cruelty. She be
damned! He would not. He could not. He must save
himself now at whatever cost. And so a determined attempt
not to see her any more at all—never to speak to her openly
anywhere—or to admit any responsibility as to all this.
Yet, because of her inexperience, youth and faith thus far,
no willingness on her part to believe this. It could not be.
She had not even so much as sensed it before. Yet his continuing
indifference which could only be interpreted one
way. The absences—the excuses! And then one day,
when pains and terror seized on her and thereby drove her
to him, he looking her calmly and brazenly in the eye and
announcing: “But I didn’t really promise to marry you,
and you know I didn’t. Besides, I’m not to blame any
more than you are. You don’t suppose that just because
you don’t know how to take care of yourself I’ve got to
marry you now, do you?”</p>

<p>His eyes now for the first time were truly hard. His
intention to end this by one fell blow was very definite.
And the blow was sufficient at the moment to half unseat
the romantic and all but febrile reason of this girl, who
up to this hour had believed so foolishly in love. Why,
how could this be? The horror of it! The implied
disaster. And then half in understanding, half in befuddled
unreason, exclaiming: “But, Ed! Ed! You can’t mean that.
Why, it isn’t true! You know it isn’t! You promised.
You swore. You know I never wanted to—until you made
me. Why ... oh, what’ll I do now? My father! I
don’t know what he’ll do to me or to you either. Oh, dear!
Oh, dear!” And frantically, and without sufficient balance
to warrant the name of reason, beginning to wring her
hands and twist and sway in a kind of physical as well as
mental agony.</p>

<p>At this Hauptwanger, more determined than ever to
frighten her away from him once and for all, if possible,
exclaiming: “Oh, cut that stuff! I never said I’d marry
you, and you know it!” and turning on his heel and leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
her to rejoin the chattering group of youths on the corner,
with whom, before her arrival, he had been talking.
And as much to sustain himself in this fatal decision as well
as to carry it off before them all, adding: “Gee, these skirts!
It does beat hell, don’t it?”</p>

<p>Yet now a little fearsome, if vain and contemptuous, for
the situation was beginning to take on a gloomy look. But
just the same when Johnny Martin, one of his companions
and another aspirant for street corner and Lothario honors,
remarked: “I saw her here last night lookin’ for you, Ed.
Better look out. One of these skirts is likely to do somepin
to you one of these days”—he calmly extracted a cigarette
from a silver cigarette case and without a look in the direction
of the half-swooning Ida, said: “Is that so? Well,
maybe. We’ll see first.” And then with a nonchalant
nod in the direction of Ida, who, too tortured to even retreat,
was standing quite still, exclaimed: “Gee, these Germans!
She’s got an old man that wouldn’t ever let her find out
anything and now because she thinks there’s something
wrong with her she blames me.” And just then, another
intimate approaching, and with news of two girls who were
to meet them somewhere later, exclaiming: “Hello, Skate!
Everything set? All right, then. We might as well go
along. S’long, fellas.” And stepping briskly and vigorously
away.</p>

<p>But the stricken and shaken Ida still loitered under the
already partially denuded September trees. And with the
speeding street and auto cars with their horns and bells and
the chattering voices and shuffling feet of pedestrians and
the blazing evening lights making a kind of fanfare of
color and sound. Was it cold? Or was it only herself who
was numb and cold? He would not marry her! He had
never said he would! How could he say that now? And
her father to deal with—and her physical condition to be
considered!</p>

<p>As she stood there without moving, there flashed before
her a complete panorama of all the paths and benches of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
King Lake Park—the little boats that slipped here and
there under the trees at night in the summertime—a boy
and a girl—a boy and a girl—a boy and a girl—to each boat.
And the oars dragging most inconsequentially—and infatuated
heads together—infatuated hearts beating ecstatically—suffocatingly
strong. Yet now—after so many kisses and
promises, the lie given to her dreams, her words—his words
on which her words had been based—the lie given to kisses—hours,
days, weeks, months of unspeakable bliss—the lie
given to her own security and hopes, forever. Oh, it would
be best to die—it would—it would.</p>

<p>And then a slow and dragging return to her room, where
because of the absence of her father and stepmother she
managed to slip into her bed and lie there, thinking. But
with a kind of fever, alternating with chills—and both shot
through with most menacing pains due to this most astounding
revelation. And with a sudden and keener volume of
resentment than she had ever known gathering in her brain.
The cruelty! The cruelty! And the falsehood! He had
not only lied but insulted her as well. He who only five
months before had sought her so eagerly with his eyes and
intriguing smile. The liar! The brute! The monster!
Yet linked and interwoven with such thoughts as these, a
lacerating desire not to believe them—to turn back a month—two—three—to
find in his eyes somewhere a trace of
something that would gainsay it all. Oh, Ed! Ed!</p>

<p>And so the night going—and the dawn coming. A horrible
lacerating day. And after that other days. And
with no one to talk to—no one. If only she could tell her
stepmother all. And so other days and nights—all alone.
And with blazing, searing, whirling, disordered thoughts
in unbroken procession stalking her like demons. The outside
world in case she were to be thrust into it! Her own
unfamiliarity and hence fear of it! Those chattering, gaping
youths on the corners—the girls she knew—their
thoughts, since they must all soon know. Her loneliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
without love. These and a hundred related thoughts dancing
a fantastic, macabre mental dance before her.</p>

<p>But even so, within her own brain the persistent and
growing illusion that all she had heard from him was not
true—a chimera—and so for the time being at least continued
faith in the value of pleading. Her wonderful
lover. It must be that still some understanding could be
reached. Yet with growing evidence that by no plea or
plaint was he to be restored to his former attitude. For,
in answer to notes, waiting at the corners, at the end of
the street which led down to his father’s coal-dock, in the
vicinity of his home—silence, evasions, or direct insults, and
sneers, even.</p>

<p>“What’s the big idea, following me around, anyhow?
You think I haven’t anything else to do but listen to you?
Say, I told you in the first place I couldn’t marry, didn’t I?
And now because you think there’s something wrong with
you, you want to make me responsible. Well, I’m not the
only fellow in this neighborhood. And everybody knows
that.”</p>

<p>He paused there, because as he saw this last declaration
had awakened in her a latent strength and determination
never previously shown in any way. The horror of that
to her, as he could see. The whiteness of her face afterwards
and on the instant. The blazing electric points
within the pupils of her eyes. “That’s a lie, and you know
it! It’s not true! Oh, how terrible! And for you to
say that to me! I see it all now. You’re just a sneak and
a coward. You were just fooling with me all the time,
then! You never intended to marry me, and now because
you’re afraid you think you can get out of it that way—by
trying to blame it on some one else. You coward! Oh,
aren’t you the small one, though! And after all the things
you said to me—the promises! As though I even thought
of any one else in my life! You dare to say that to me,
when you know so well!”</p>

<p>Her face was still lily white. And her hands. Her eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
flashed with transcendent and yet helpless and defeated
misery. And yet, despite her rage—in the center of this
very misery—love itself—strong, vital, burning love—the
very core of it. But so tortured that already it
was beginning to drive the tears to her eyes.</p>

<p>And he knowing so thoroughly that this love was still
there, now instantly seizing on these latest truthful words
of hers as an insult—something on which to base an assumed
grievance.</p>

<p>“Is that so? A coward, eh? Well, let’s see what you
draw down for that, you little dumb-bell.” And so turning
on his heel—the strongest instinct in him—his own
social salvation in this immediate petty neighborhood at the
present time uppermost in his mind. And without a look
behind.</p>

<p>But Ida, her fear and terror at its height, calling: “Ed!
Ed! You come back here! Don’t you dare to leave me
like this! I won’t stand for it. I tell you, I won’t! You
come back here now! Do you hear me?” And seeing that
he continued on briskly and indifferently, running after
him, unbelievably tense and a little beside herself—almost
mentally unaccountable for the moment. And he, seeing
her thus and amazed and troubled by this new turn his
problem had taken, turning abruptly with: “Say! You cut
out o’ this now before I do something to you, do you hear?
I’m not the one to let you pull this stuff on me. You got
yourself into this and now you can get yourself out of it.
Beat it before I do something to you, do you hear?” And
now he drew nearer—and with such a threatening and
savage look in his eyes that for the first time in all her contact
with him Ida grew fearful of him. That angry, sullen
face. Those fierce, cruel, savage eyes. Was it really true
that in addition to all the rest he would really do her physical
harm? Then she had not understood him at all, ever.
And so pausing and standing quite still, that same fear of
physical force that had kept her in subjection to her father
overawing her here. At the same time, Hauptwanger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
noting the effect of his glowering rage, now added: “Don’t
come near me any more, do you hear? If you do, you’re
goin’ to get something you’re not going to like. I’m through,
and I’m through for good, see.”</p>

<p>Once more he turned and strode away, this time toward
the central business district of the High and Warren Avenue
region—the while Ida, too shaken by this newest
development to quite grasp the full measure of her own
necessity or courage, stood there. The horror of it! The
disgrace! The shame! For now, surely, tragedy was upon
her!</p>

<p>For the time being, in order to save herself from too
much publicity, she began to move on—walk—only slowly
and with whirling, staggering thoughts that caused her to
all but lurch. And so, shaking and pale, she made her way
once more to her home, where she stole into her room unnoticed.
Yet, now, too tortured to cry but thinking
grimly—fiercely at moments—at other times most weakly
and feebly even—on all that had so recently occurred.</p>

<p>Her father! Her stepmother! If he—she—they should
come to know! But no—something else must happen
before ever that should be allowed to happen. She
must leave—or—or, better yet—maybe drown herself—make
way with herself in some way—or—</p>

<p>In the garret of this home, to which as a child on certain
days she had frequently resorted to play, was an old
wire clothes-line on which was hung an occasional wash.
And now—might not that—in the face of absolute fiasco
here—might not that—she had read of ending one’s life
in that manner. And it was so unlikely that any one would
trouble to look there—until—until—well—</p>

<p>But would she? Could she? This strange budding of
life that she sensed—feared. Was it fair to it? Herself? To
life that had given it to her? And when she desired so to
live? And when he owed her something—at least help to her
and her—her—her—No, she could not—would not think of
that yet, especially when to die this way would be but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
clear the way to easier and happier conquests for him.
Never! Never! She would kill him first—and then
herself. Or expose him and so herself—and then—and
then—</p>

<p>But again her father! Her stepmother! The disgrace!
And so—</p>

<p>In her father’s desk at the store was a revolver—a
large, firm, squarish mechanism which, as she had heard
him say, fired eight shots. It was so heavy, so blue, so cold.
She had seen it, touched it, lifted it once—but with a kind
of terror, really. It was always so identified with death—anger—not
life—But now—supposing—supposing, if she
desired to punish Edward and herself—or just herself alone.
But no, that was not the way. What was the way, anyhow?
What was the way?</p>

<p>And so now brooding in a tortured and half-demented
way until her father, noting her mental state, inquired
solemnly as to what had come over her of late. Had she
had a quarrel with Hauptwanger? He had not seen him
about recently. Was she ill in any way? Her appetite had
certainly fallen off. She ate scarcely anything. But receiving
a prompt “No” to both inquiries he remained curious
but inclined to suspend further inquiry for the time
being. There was something, of course, but no doubt it
would soon come out.</p>

<p>But now—in the face of this—of course there must be
action—decision. And so, in view of the thoughts as to
self-destruction and the revolver, a decision to try the effect
of a physical threat upon Hauptwanger. She would just
frighten him. She might even point the gun at him—and
see what he would do then. Of course, she could not kill
him—she knew that. But supposing—supposing—one
aimed—but not at him, really—and—and—(but, oh no!)
a spit of fire, a puff of smoke, a deadly bullet—into his
heart—into hers afterward, of course. No, no! For then
what? Where?</p>

<p>A dozen, a score, of times in less than two days she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
approached the drawer that held the revolver and looked at
it—finally lifting it up but with no thought of doing more
than just that at the moment. It was so heavy, so cold, so
blue. The very weight and meaning of it terrorized her,
although at last—after the twentieth attempt—she was able
to fit it into her bosom in such a way that it lay quite firm
and still. The horror of it—cold against her breast, where
so often during the summer his head had lain.</p>

<p>And then one afternoon, when she could scarcely endure
the strain longer—her father demanding: “What is the
matter with you, anyhow? Do you know what you’re
doing half the time? Is there anything wrong between you
and that beau of yours? I see he doesn’t come around any
more. It is time that you either married or had nothing
more to do with him, anyway. I don’t want any silly
nonsense between you and him, you know.” And this
effected the very decision which she had most dreaded.
Now ... now ... she must act. This evening—at least
she must see him again and tell him that she was going to
see his father and reveal all—furthermore, that if he did
not marry her she would kill him and herself. Show him
the gun, maybe, and frighten him with it—if she could—but
at any rate make a last plea as well as a threat. If
only—if only he would listen this time—not turn on her—become
frightened, maybe, and help her,—not curse—or drive
her away.</p>

<p>There was the coal-yard of his father that was at the
end of an inlet giving into the river. Or his own home.
She might go first to the coal office. He would be sure to
be leaving there at half past five, or at six he would be nearing
his home. At seven or half past departing from that
again very likely to see—to see—whom? But best—best to
go to the coal office first. He would be coming from there
alone. It would be the quickest.</p>

<p>And Hauptwanger coming out of the coal office on this
particular evening in the mood and with the air of one with
whom all was well. But in the windy dusk of this November<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
evening, arc lights blazing in the distance, the sound
of distant cars, distant life, the wind whipping crisp leaves
along the ground—the figure of a girl—a familiar cape
about her shoulders, suddenly emerging from behind a pile
of brick he was accustomed to pass.</p>

<p>“Ed! I want to talk to you a minute.”</p>

<p>“You again! What the hell did I tell you? I ain’t got
no time to talk to you, and I won’t! What did I....”</p>

<p>“Now listen, Ed, stop that, now! I’m desperate. <em>I’m
desperate</em>, Ed, do you hear? Can’t you see?” Her voice
was staccato—almost shrill and yet mournful, too. “I’ve
come to tell you that you’ve got to marry me now. <em>You’ve
got</em> to—do you hear?” She was fumbling at her breast
where lay that heavy blue thing—no longer so cold as when
she had placed it there. The handle was upward. She
must draw it now—show it—or hold it under her cloak
ready so that at the right moment she could show it—and
make him understand that unless he did something....
But her hand shaking so that she could scarcely hold it.
It was so heavy—so terrible. She could scarcely hear herself
adding: “Otherwise, I’m going to your father and mine,
now. My father may do something terrible to me but he’ll
do more to you. And so will your father when he knows....
But, anyway....” She was about to add: “You’ve
got to marry me, and right away too, or, or, I’m going to
kill you and myself, that’s all—” and then to produce the
revolver, and wave it before him in a threatening dramatic
manner.</p>

<p>But before that the uncalculated and non-understanding
fury of Hauptwanger. “Well, of all the nerve! Say, cut
this out, will ya? Who do you think you are? What did
I tell you? Go to my father, if you want to. Go to yours!
Who’s afraid? Do you think they’re going to believe a
—— like you? I never had anything to do with you, and
that’s that!” And then in his anger giving her a push—as
much to overawe her as anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>But then, in spite of her desire not to give way, fury,
blindness, pain,—whirling, fiery sparks, such as never in
all her life before had she seen—and executing strange,
rhythmic, convoluting orbits in her brain—swift, eccentric,
red and yet beautiful orbits. And in the center of them
the face of Hauptwanger—her beloved—but not as it was
now—oh, no—but rather haloed by a strange white light—as
it was under the trees in the spring. And herself turning,
and in spite of the push, jumping before him.</p>

<p>“You will marry me, Ed, you will! You will! You see
this? You will marry me!”</p>

<p>And then, as much to her astonishment as to his—yet
with no particular terror to either of them—the thing spitting
flame—making a loud noise—jumping almost out of
her hand—so much so that before she could turn it away
again there was another report—another flash of red in the
dusk. And then Hauptwanger, too astonished quite for
words at the moment, exclaiming: “Jesus! What are
you....” And then, because of a sharp pain in his chest,
putting his hand there and adding: “Oh, Christ! I’m
shot!” and falling forward to one side of her....</p>

<p>And then herself—those same whirling red sparks in her
brain, saying: “Now, now—I must kill myself, too. I must.
I must. I must run somewhere and turn this on myself,”
only quite unable to lift it at the moment—and because of
some one—a man—approaching—a voice—footsteps,
running—herself beginning to run—for some tree—some
wall—some gate or doorway where she might stop
and fire on herself. But a voice: “Hey! Stop that
girl!” “Murder!” And another voice from somewhere
else: “Hey! Murder! Stop that girl!” And footsteps, hard,
quick ones, immediately behind her. And a hand grabbing
hers in which was still the pistol, wildly and yet unwittingly
held. And as the other hand wrenched at her hand—“Gimme
that gun!” And then a strong youth whom she
had never seen before—and yet not unlike Eddie either—turning
her about—restraining her— “Say, you! What the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
devil is this, anyhow? Come back here. You can’t get
away with this.”</p>

<p>And yet at the same time not unfriendly eyes looking
into hers, strong hands holding her, but not too roughly,
and herself exclaiming: “Oh, let me go! Let me go! I
want to die, too, I tell you! Let me go!” And sobbing
great, dry, shaking sobs.</p>

<p>But after that—and all so quickly—crowds—crowds—men
and women, boys and girls, and finally policemen
gathering about her, each with the rules of his training
firmly in mind to get as much general information as possible;
to see that the wounded man was hurried to a hospital,
the girl to a precinct police station; the names and
addresses of various witnesses secured. But with the lorn
Ida in a state of collapse—seated upon a doorstep in a yard
surrounded by a pushing crowd, while voices rang in her
ears: “Where? What? How?” “Sure, sure! Just now,
right back there. Sure, they’re calling the ambulance.”
“He’s done for, I guess. Twice in the breast. He can’t
live.” “Gee! He’s all covered with blood.” “Sure, she
did. With a revolver—a great big one. The cop’s got it.
She was tryin’ to get away. Sure, Jimmie Allen caught
her. He was just comin’ home.” “Yeah. She’s the daughter
of old Zobel who keeps the paint store up here in Warren
Avenue. I know her. An’ he’s the son of this Hauptwanger
here who owns the coal-yard. I used to work for
’em. He lives up in Grey Street.”</p>

<p>But in the meantime young Hauptwanger unconscious and
being transferred to an operating table at Mercy Hospital—his
case pronounced hopeless—twenty-four hours of life
at the very most. And his father and mother hearing the
news and running there. And in the same period the tortured
Ida transferred to Henderson Avenue Police Station,
where in a rear inquisitorial chamber, entirely surrounded
by policemen and detectives, she was questioned and requestioned.
“Yah say yah seen this fella for the first time
over a year ago? Is that right? He just moved into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
neighborhood a little while before? Ain’t that so?” And
the disconsolate, half-conscious Ida nodding her head. And
outside a large, morbid, curious crowd. A beautiful girl!
A young man dying! Some sex mystery here.</p>

<p>And in the interim Zobel himself and his wife, duly informed
by a burly policeman, hurrying white-faced and
strained to the station. My God! My God! And both
rushing in breathless. And beads of perspiration on Zobel’s
forehead and hands—and misery, misery eating at his vitals.
What! His Ida had shot some one! Young Hauptwanger!
And in the street, near his office! Murder! Great God!
Then there was something between them. There was.
There was. But might he not have known? Her white face.
Her dreary, forsaken manner these later days. She had
been betrayed. That was it. Devils! Devils! That was
it! Eighty thousand hells! And after all he had said to
her! And all his and his wife’s care of her! And now
the neighbors! His business! The police! A public trial!
Possibly a sentence—a death sentence! God in heaven!
His own daughter, too! And that young scoundrel with
his fine airs and fine clothes! Why—why was it that he
had let her go with him in the first place? When he might
have known—his daughter so inexperienced. “Where is
she? My God! My God! This is terrible!”</p>

<p>But seeing her sitting there, white, doleful-looking, and
looking up at him when spoken to with an almost meaningless
look—a bloodless, smileless face—and saying: “Yes, I
shot him. Yes. Yes. He wouldn’t marry me. He should
have but he wouldn’t—and so—” And then at once crushing
her hands in a sad, tortured way and crying: “Oh, Ed!
Ed!” And Zobel exclaiming: “Ach, God! Ida! Ida! In
God’s name, it can’t be so. Why didn’t you tell me? Why
didn’t you come to me? Am I not your father! I would
have understood. Of course! Of course! I would have
gone to his father—to him. But now—this—and now—”
and he began to wring his own hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>Yet the principal thought in his mind that now the
world would know all— And after all his efforts. And beginning
volubly to explain to the desk lieutenant and the
detectives and policemen all that he knew. But the only
thought afloat in the unhappy Ida’s brain, once she awakened
again, was: Was this really her father? And was he
talking so—of help? That she might have come to him—for
what—when she had thought—that—that he would not
be like that to her. But ... after a time again ...
there was Ed to be thought of. That terrible scene. That
terrible accident. She had not intended to do that—really.
She had not. She had not. No! But was he really dead?
Had she really killed him? That push—almost a blow
it was—those words. But still— Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
And then beginning to cry to herself, silently and deeply,
while Zobel and his wife bent over her for the first time
in true sympathy. The complications of life! The terrors!
There was no peace for any one on this earth—no peace—no
peace. All was madness, really, and sorrow. But they
would stand by her now—yes, yes.</p>

<p>But then the reporters. A public furore fanned by the
newspapers, with their men and women writers, pen and
ink artists, photographers. Their editorials: “Beautiful
girl of seventeen shoots lover, twenty-one. Fires two bullets
into body of man she charges with refusing to keep faith.
About to become a mother. Youth likely to die. Girl
admits crime. Pleads to be left alone in misery. Parents
of both in despair.” And then columns and columns, day
after day—since on the following afternoon at three Hauptwanger
did die—admitting that he had wronged her. And
a coroner’s jury, called immediately afterwards, holding the
girl for subsequent action by the Grand Jury, and without
bail. Yet, because of her beauty and the “pathos” of
the case—letters to the newspapers, from ministers, society
men and women, politicians and the general public,
demanding that this wronged girl about to become a mother,
and who had committed no wrong other than that of loving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
too well—if not wisely—be not severely dealt with—be
forgiven—be admitted to bail. No jury anywhere would
convict her. Not in America. Indeed, it would “go hard”
with any jury that would attempt to “further punish” a
girl who had already suffered so much. Plainly it was the
duty of the judge in this case to admit this poor wronged
soul to bail and the peace and quiet of some home or institution
where her child might be born, especially since already
a woman of extreme wealth and social position, deeply
stirred by the pathos of this drama, had not only come
forward to sympathize with this innocent victim of love
and order and duty, but had offered any amount of bail that
she might be released to the peace and quiet of her own
home—there to await the outcome of her physical condition
as well as the unavoidable prosecution which must fix her
future.</p>

<p>And so, to her wonder and confusion, Ida finally released
in the custody of this outwardly sober and yet inwardly
emotional woman, who ever since the first day of her imprisonment
in the central county jail had sought to ingratiate
herself into her good graces and emotions—a
woman middle-aged and plain but soft-voiced and kindly-mannered,
who over and over repeated that she understood,
that she also had suffered—that her heart had been
torn, too—and that she, Ida, need never worry. And so
Ida finally transferred (a bailed prisoner subject to return
upon demand) to the wide acres and impressive chambers
of a once country but now city residence, an integral part
of the best residence area of the city. And there, to her
astonishment and wonder—and this in spite of her despair—all
needful equipment and service provided—a maid and
servants, her food served to her in her room when she
wished—silence or entertainment as she chose. And with
her own parents allowed to visit her whenever she chose.
Yet she was so uncomfortable in their presence always now.
True, they were kind—gentle, whenever they came.
They spoke of the different life that was to be after this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
great crisis was truly past—the birth of the child, which was
never other than indirectly referred to, or the trial, which
was to follow later. There was to be a new store in a new
neighborhood. The old one had already been offered for sale.
And after that ... well, peace perhaps, or a better life.
But even in her father’s eyes as he spoke could she not see the
weight of care which he now shouldered? She had sinned!
She had killed a man! And wrecked another family—the
hearts of two other parents as well as her father’s own
peace of mind and commercial and social well-being. And
in all his charity, was there room for that? In the solemnity
of his manner, as well as that of her stepmother, could
she feel that there was?</p>

<p>Yet in the main, and because her mood and health seemed
to require it, she was now left to contemplate the inexplicable
chain of events which her primary desire for love had brought
about. The almost amazing difference in the mental attitude
of her parents toward her now and before this dreadful
and unfortunate event in her life! So considerate and sympathetic
now as to result in an offer of a happier home for her
and her child in the future, whereas before all was—or as she
sensed it—so threatening and desperate. The strange and
to her inexplicable attitude of this woman even—so kind
and generous—and this in the face of her sin and shame.</p>

<p>And yet, what peace or quiet could there be for her here
or anywhere now? The terrible torture that had preceded
that terrible accident! Her Edward’s cry! His death!
And when she loved him so! Had! Did now! And yet
by his dread perverseness, cruelty, brutality, he had taken
himself from her. But still, still—now that he was gone—now
that in dying, as she heard he had said, he had been
“stuck on her” at first, that she had “set him crazy,” but
that afterwards, because of his parents, as well as hers, he
had decided that he would not marry her—she could not
help but feel more kindly to him. He had been cruel. But
had he not died? And at her hands. She had killed him—murdered
him. Oh, yes, she had. Oh! Oh! Oh! For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
in connection with the actual scene did she not recall some
one crying that his shirt front had been all bloody. Oh!
Oh! Oh! And in her heart, no doubt, when she had jumped
in front of him there in the dusk had been rage—rage and
hate even, too, for the moment. Oh, yes. But he had cried:
“Oh, Christ! I’m shot!” (Her Edward’s cry.)</p>

<p>And so, even in the silence of these richly furnished rooms,
with a servant coming to her call, hot, silent tears and deep,
racking sobs—when no one was supposed to see or hear—and
thoughts, thoughts, thoughts—sombre, bleak—as to her
lack of sense, her lack of courage or will to end it all for
herself on that dreadful evening when she so easily might
have. And now here she had plighted her word that she
would do nothing rash—would not attempt to take her life.
But the future! The future! And what had she not seen
since that dreadful night! Edward’s father and mother at
the inquest! And how they had looked at her! Hauptwanger,
senior—his strong, broad German face marked with
a great anguish. And Mrs. Hauptwanger—small and all
in black, and with great hollow rings under her eyes. And
crying silently nearly all the time. And both had sworn
that they knew nothing of Edward’s conduct, or of his
definite interest in her. He was a headstrong, virile, restless
boy. They had a hard time controlling him. And yet
he had not been a bad boy, either—headstrong but willing
to work—and gay—their only son.</p>

<p>At one point in these extensive grounds—entirely surrounded
by Lombardy poplars now leafless—there stood a
fountain drained of its water for the winter. But upon
the pedestal, upon a bronze rock, at the foot of which washed
bronze waves of the Rhine, a Rhine maiden of the blonde
German Lorelei type, standing erect and a-dream, in youth,
in love. And at her feet, on his knees, a German lover of
the Ritter type—vigorous, uniformed, his fair blond head
and face turned upward to the beauty about whose hips his
arms were clasped—his look seeking, urgent. And upon
his fair bronze hair, her right hand, the while she bent on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
him a yearning, yielding glance. Oh, Edward! Oh, love!
Spring! She must not come out here any more. And yet
evening after evening in early December, once the first
great gust of this terrific storm had subsided and she was
seeing things in a less drastic light, she was accustomed to
return to look at it. And sometimes, even in January, a
new moon overhead would suggest King Lake Park! The
little boats gliding here and there! She and Edward in
one. Herself leaning back and dreaming as now—now—this
figure of the girl on the rock was doing. And he—he—at
her knees. To be sure, he had cursed her. He
had said the indifferent, cruel words that had at last driven
her to madness. But once he had loved her just this way.
It was there, and only there, that she found spiritual comfort
in her sorrow—</p>

<p>But then, in due course, the child—with all these
thoughts, moods enveloping it. And after that the trial,
with her prompt acquittal. A foreseen conclusion. And
with loud public acclaim for that verdict also, since it was
all for romance and drastic drama. And then the final
leaving of these great rooms and this personal intimate
affection that had been showered upon her. For after all
the legal, if not the emotional problem, had now been
solved. And since her father was not one who was poor
or welcomed charity—a contemplated and finally accomplished
return to a new world—the new home and store
which had been established in a very different and remote
part of the city. The child a boy. That was good, for
eventually he could care for himself. He would not need
her. The new paint shop was near another cross business
street, near another moving-picture theatre. And boys and
girls here as elsewhere—on the corners—going arm in
arm—and herself again at home cooking, sewing, cleaning
as before. And with Mrs. Zobel as reserved and dubious
as before. For after all, had she not made a mess of her
life, and for what? What now? Here forever as a fixture?
And even though Zobel, in spite of his grimness, was becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
fond of the child. How wretched, how feeble life
really was!</p>

<p>But far away King Lake Park and the old neighborhood.
And thoughts that went back to it constantly. She had
been so happy the summer before. And now this summer!
And other summers to come—even though perhaps some
time—once little Eric was grown—there might be some
other lover—who would not mind— But, no—no, not
that. Never! She did not want that. Could not—would
not endure it.</p>

<p>And so at last of a Saturday afternoon, when she had the
excuse of certain things needed for Eric, a trip to presumably
the central business heart—whereas, in reality, it
was to King Lake Park she was going. And once there—the
little boats, the familiar paths—a certain nook under
the overarching bushes and trees. She knew it so well.
It was here that she had demanded to be let out in order
that she might go home by herself—so shocked, so ashamed.
Yet now seeking it.</p>

<p>The world does not understand such things. It is so
busy with so many, many things.</p>

<p>And then dusk—though she should have been returning.
Her boy! He would miss her! And then a little wind
with a last faint russet glow in the west. And then stars!
Quite all the world had gone to its dinner now. The park
was all but empty. The water here was so still—so agate.
(The world—the world—it will never understand, will
it?) Where would Edward be? Would he be meeting
her somewhere? Greeting her? Would he forgive,—when
she told him all—could she find him, perchance?
(The world—the busy, strident, indifferent, matter-of-fact
world—how little it knows.)</p>

<p>And then a girl in the silence, in the shadow, making her
way down to the very spot that the nose of their boat had
nuzzled but one short summer before. And calmly stepping
into the water and wading out to her knees—to her waist—her
breasts—in the mild, caressing water—and then to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
lips and over them—and finally, deliberately—conclusively—sinking
beneath its surface and without a cry or sigh.</p>

<p>The world does not understand such things. The tide
of life runs too fast. So much that is beautiful—terrible—sweeps
by—by—by—without thought—without notice in
the great volume.</p>

<p>And yet her body was found—her story retold in great,
flaring headlines. (Ida Zobel—Girl Slayer of Hauptwanger
a Suicide.) And then ... and then ... forgotten.</p>

THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">He</span> came to it across the new bridge, from the south
where the greater city lay—the older portion—and
where he had left his car, and paused at the nearer bridgehead
to look at it—the eddying water of the river below,
the new docks and piers built on either side since he had left,
twenty years before; the once grassy slopes on the farther
shore, now almost completely covered with factories, although
he could see too, among them, even now, traces of
the old, out-of-the-way suburb which he and Marie had
known. Chadds Bridge, now an integral part of the greater
city, connected by car lines and through streets, was then
such a simple, unpretentious affair, a little suburban village
just on the edge of this stream and beyond the last straggling
northward streets of the great city below, where the car
lines stopped and from which one had to walk on foot across
this bridge in order to take advantage of the rural quiet and
the cheaper—much cheaper—rents, so all-important to him
then.</p>

<p>Then he was so poor—he and Marie—a mere stripling of
a mechanic and inventor, a student of aeronautics, electricity,
engineering, and what not, but newly married and without
a dollar, and no clear conception of how his future was to
eventuate, whereas now—but somehow he did not want to
think of now. Now he was so very rich, comparatively
speaking, older, wiser, such a forceful person commercially
and in every other way, whereas then he was so lean and
pathetic and worried and wistful—a mere uncertain stripling,
as he saw himself now, with ideas and ambitions and dreams<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
which were quite out of accord with his immediate prospects
or opportunities. It was all right to say, as some one had—Emerson,
he believed—“hitch your wagon to a star.” But
some people hitched, or tried to, before they were ready.
They neglected some of the slower moving vehicles about
them, and so did not get on at all—or did not seem to, for
the time being.</p>

<p>And that had been his error. He was growing at the
time, of course, but he was so restless, so dissatisfied with
himself, so unhappy. All the world was apparently tinkling
and laughing by, eating, drinking, dancing, growing richer,
happier, every minute; whereas he—he and Marie, and the
two babies which came a little later—seemed to make no
progress at all. None. They were out of it, alone, hidden
away in this little semi-rural realm, and it was all so disturbing
when elsewhere was so much—to him, at least, if not to
her—of all that was worth while—wealth, power, gayety,
repute. How intensely, savagely almost, he had craved all
of those things in those days, and how far off they still were
at that time!</p>

<p>Marie was not like him, soft, clinging little thing that she
was, inefficient in most big ways, and yet dear and helpful
enough in all little ones—oh, so very much so.</p>

<p>When first he met her in Philadelphia, and later when he
brought her over to New York, it seemed as though he could
not possibly have made a better engagement for himself.
Marie was so sweet, so gentle, with her waxy white pallor,
delicately tinted cheeks, soft blackish brown eyes that sought
his so gently always, as if seeming to ask, “And what can
I do for my dearie now? What can he teach me to do for
him?” She was never his equal, mentally or spiritually—that
was the dreadful discovery he had made a few months
after the first infatuation had worn off, after the ivory of her
forehead, the lambent sweetness of her eyes, her tresses, and
her delicately rounded figure, had ceased to befuddle his more
poetical brain. But how delightful she seemed then in her
shabby little clothes and her shabbier little home—all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
more so because her delicate white blossom of a face was
such a contrast to the drear surroundings in which it shone.
Her father was no more than a mechanic, she a little store
clerk in the great Rand department store in Philadelphia
when he met her, he nothing more than an experimental assistant
with the Culver Electric Company, with no technical
training of any kind, and only dreams of a technical course
at some time or other. The beginnings of his career were so
very vague.</p>

<p>His parents were poor too, and he had had to begin to earn
his own living, or share, at fourteen. And at twenty-four he
had contracted this foolish marriage when he was just beginning
to dream of bigger things, to see how they were done,
what steps were necessary, what studies, what cogitations and
hard, grinding sacrifices even, before one finally achieved anything,
especially in the electrical world. The facts which
had begun to rise and take color and classify themselves in
his mind had all then to develop under the most advantageous
conditions thereafter. His salary did not rise at once
by any means, just because he was beginning to think of bigger
things. He was a no better practical assistant in a laboratory
or the equipment department of the several concerns for
which he worked, because in his brain were already seething
dim outlines of possible improvements in connection with
arms, the turbine gun, electro-magnetic distance control, and
the rotary excavator. He had ideas, but also as he realized
at the time he would have to study privately and long in
order to make them real; and his studies at night and Sundays
and holidays in the libraries and everywhere else, made
him no more helpful, if as much so, in his practical, everyday
corporation labors. In fact, for a long time when their
finances were at the lowest ebb and the two children had
appeared, and they all needed clothes and diversion, and his
salary had not been raised, it seemed as though he were
actually less valuable to everybody.</p>

<p>But in the meantime Marie had worked for and with him,
dear little thing, and although she had seemed so wonderful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
at first, patient, enduring, thoughtful, later because of their
poverty and so many other things which hampered and
seemed to interfere with his work, he had wearied of her a
little. Over in Philadelphia, where he had accompanied her
home of an evening and had watched her help her mother,
saw her set the table, wash the dishes, straighten up the house
after dinner, and then if it were pleasant go for a walk with
him, she seemed ideal, just the wife for him, indeed. Later
as he sensed the world, its hardness, its innate selfishness, the
necessity for push, courage, unwillingness to be a slave and a
drudge, these earlier qualities and charms were the very
things that militated against her in his mind. Poor little
Marie!</p>

<p>But in other ways his mind was not always on his work,
either. Sometimes it was on his dreams of bigger things.
Sometimes it was on his silly blindness in wanting to get married
so soon, in being betrayed by the sweet innocence and
beauty of Marie into saddling himself with this burden when
he was scarcely prepared, as he saw after he was married, to
work out his own life on a sensible, economic basis. A
thought which he had encountered somewhere in some book
of philosophy or other (he was always reading in those days)
had haunted him—“He that hath wife and children hath
given hostages to fortune”—and that painful thought seemed
to grow with each succeeding day. Why had he been so
foolish, why so very foolish, as to get married when he was
so unsuitably young! That was a thing the folly of which
irritated him all the time.</p>

<p>Not that Marie was not all she should be—far from it!—nor
the two little boys (both boys, think of that!), intensely
precious to him at first. No, that was not it, but this, that
whatever the values and the charms of these (and they were
wonderful at first), he personally was not prepared to bear
or enjoy them as yet. He was too young, too restless, too
nebulous, too inventively dreamful. He did not, as he had
so often thought since, know what he wanted—only, when
they began to have such a very hard time, he knew he did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
not want that. Why, after the first year of their marriage,
when Peter was born, and because of better trade conditions
in the electrical world, they had moved over here (he was
making only twenty-two dollars a week at the time), everything
had seemed to go wrong. Indeed, nothing ever seemed
to go right any more after that, not one thing.</p>

<p>First it was Marie’s illness after Peter’s birth, which kept
him on tenterhooks and took all he could rake and scrape
and save to pay the doctor’s bill, and stole half her beauty,
if not more. She always looked a little pinched and weak
after that. (And he had charged that up to her, too!) Then
it was some ailment which affected Peter for months and
which proved to be undernourishment, due to a defect in
Marie’s condition even after she had seemingly recovered.
Then, two years later, it was the birth of Frank, due to
another error, of course, he being not intended in Marie’s
frail state; and then his own difficulties with the manager of
the insulating department of the International Electric, due
to his own nervous state, his worries, his consciousness of
error in the manipulation of his own career—and Marie’s.
Life was slipping away, as he saw it then and he kept thinking
he was growing older, was not getting on as he had
thought he should, was not achieving his technical education;
he was saddled with a family which would prevent him from
ever getting on. Here, in this neighborhood, all this had
occurred—this quiet, run-down realm, so greatly changed
since he had seen it last. Yes, it had all happened here.</p>

<p>But how peaceful it was to-day, although changed. How
the water ran under this bridge now, as then, eddying out to
sea. And how this late October afternoon reminded him of
that other October afternoon when they had first walked up
here—warm, pleasant, colorful. Would he ever forget that
afternoon? He had thought he was going to do so much
better—was praying that he would, and they had done so
much worse. He, personally, had grown so restless and
dissatisfied with himself and her and life. And things
seemed to be almost as bad as they could be, drifting indefinitely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
on to nothing. Indeed, life seemed to gather
as a storm and break. He was discharged from the International
Electric, due supposedly to his taking home for
a night a battery for an experiment he was making but
in reality because of the opposition of his superior, based on
the latter’s contempt for his constantly (possibly) depressed
and dissatisfied air, his brooding mien, and some minor inattentions
due to the state of his mind at the time.</p>

<p>Then, quite as swiftly (out of black plotting or evil
thoughts of his own, perhaps), Peter had died of pneumonia.
And three days later Frank. There were two funerals, two
dreary, one-carriage affairs—he remembered that so well!—for
they had no money; and his pawned watch, five dollars
from Marie’s mother, and seven chemical and electrical
works sold to an old book man had provided the cash advance
required by the undertaker! Then, spiritually, something
seemed to break within him. He could not see this
world, this immediate life in which he was involved, as having
any significance in it for himself or any one after that.
He could not stand it any more, the weariness, the boredom,
the dissatisfaction with himself, the failure of himself, the
sickening chain of disasters which had befallen this earlier
adventure. And so—</p>

<p>But that was why he was here to-day, after all these
years—twenty-four, to be exact—with his interest in this old
region so keen, if so sad. Why, there—there!—was a flock
of pigeons, just like those of old Abijah Hargot’s, flying
around the sky now, as then. And a curl of smoke creeping
up from Tanzer’s blacksmith shop, or the one that had succeeded
it, just one block from this bridge. How well he
remembered old Tanzer and his forge, his swelling muscles
and sooty face! He had always nodded in such a friendly
way as he passed and talked of the pest of flies and heat in
summer. That was why he was pausing on this bridge
to-day, just to see once more, to feel, standing in the pleasant
afternoon sun of this October day and gazing across the
swirling waters below at the new coal-pockets, the enlarged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
lamp works of the George C. Woodruff Company, once a
mere shed hidden away at a corner of this nearest street and
rented out here no doubt because it was cheap and Woodruff
was just beginning—just as he did twenty-four years before.
Time had sped by so swiftly. One’s ideals and ideas changed
so. Twenty years ago he would have given so much to be
what he was now—rich and fairly powerful—and now—now—The
beauty of this old neighborhood, to-day, even.</p>

<p>The buff school which crowned the rise beyond, and the
broad asphalt of Edgewood Avenue leading up to the old
five-story flat building—the only one out here, and a failure
financially—in which he and Marie had had their miserable
little apartment—here it was, still to be seen. Yes, it and so
many other things were all here; that group of great oaks
before old Hargot’s door; the little red—if now rusted—weather-vane
over his carriage house; the tall romantic tower
of St. George’s Episcopal Church—so far to the west over
the river, and the spars and masts of vessels that still docked
here for a while. But dark memories they generated, too,
along with a certain idyllic sweetness, which had seemed to
envelop the whole at first. For though it had had sweetness
and peace at first, how much that had been bitter and spiritually
destroying had occurred here, too.</p>

<p>How well he recalled, for instance, the day he and Marie
had wandered up here, almost hand in hand, across this very
bridge and up Edgewood Avenue, nearly twenty-four years
before! They had been so happy at first, dreaming their
little dream of a wonderful future for them—and now—well,
his secret agency had brought him all there was to
know of her and her mother and her little world after he
had left. They had suffered so much, apparently, and all
on account of him. But somehow he did not want to think
of that now. It was not for that he had come to-day, but
to see, to dream over the older, the better, the first days.</p>

<p>He crossed over, following the old road which had then
been a cobble wagon trail, and turned into Edgewood Avenue
which led up past the line of semi-country homes which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
he used to dread so much, homes which because of their
superior prosperity, wide lawns, flowers and walks, made the
life which he and Marie were compelled to lead here seem
so lean and meagre by contrast. Why, yes, here was the very
residence of Gatewood, the dentist, so prosperous then and
with an office downtown; and that of Dr. Newton, whom
he had called in when Peter and Frank were taken ill that
last time; and Temple, the druggist, and Stoutmeyer, the
grocer—both of whom he had left owing money; and Dr.
Newton, too, for that matter—although all had subsequently
been paid. Not a sign of the names of either Gatewood or
Newton on their windows or gates now; not a trace of
Temple’s drug store. But here was Stoutmeyer’s grocery
just the same. And Buchspiel, the butcher. (Could he
still be alive, by any chance—was that his stout, aged figure
within?) And Ortman, the baker—not a sign of change
there. And over the way the then village school, now Public
School No. 261, as he could see. And across from it, beyond,
the slim little, almost accidental (for this region) five-story
apartment house—built because of an error in judgment, of
course, when they thought the city was going to grow out
this way—a thing of grayish-white brick. On the fifth floor
of this, in the rear, he and Marie had at last found a tiny
apartment of three rooms and bath, cheap enough for them to
occupy in the growing city and still pay their way. What
memories the mere sight of the building evoked! Where
were all the people now who used to bustle about here of a
summer evening when he and Marie were here, boys and
girls, grown men and women of the neighborhood? It had
all been so pleasant at first, Marie up there preparing dinner
and he coming home promptly at seven and sometimes
whistling as he came! He was not always unhappy, even
here.</p>

<p>Yes, all was exactly as it had been in the old days in regard
to this building and this school, even—as he lived!—a “For
Rent” sign in that very same apartment, four flights up, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
it had been that warm October day when they had first come
up here seeking.</p>

<p>But what a change in himself—stouter, so much older,
gray now. And Marie—dying a few years after in this very
region without his ever seeing her again or she him—and
she had written him such pathetic letters. She had been
broken, no doubt, spiritually and in every other way when he
left her,—no pointless vanity in that, alas—it was too sad
to involve vanity. Yes, he had done that. Would it ever
be forgiven him? Would his error of ambition and self-dissatisfaction
be seen anywhere in any kindly light—on
earth or in heaven? He had suffered so from remorse in
regard to it of late. Indeed, now that he was rich and so
successful the thought of it had begun to torture him. Some
time since—five years ago—he had thought to make amends,
but then—well, then he had found that she wasn’t any more.
Poor little Marie!</p>

<p>But these walls, so strong and enduring (stone had this
advantage over human flesh!), were quite as he had left
them, quite as they were the day he and Marie had first
come here—hopeful, cheerful, although later so depressed,
the two of them. (And he had charged her spiritually with
it all, or nearly so—its fatalities and gloom, as though she
could have avoided them!)</p>

<p>The ruthlessness of it!</p>

<p>The sheer brutality!</p>

<p>The ignorance!</p>

<p>If she could but see him now, his great shops and factories,
his hundreds of employés, his present wife and children,
his great new home—and still know how he felt about
her! If he could only call her back and tell her, apologize,
explain, make some amends! But no; life did not work that
way. Doors opened and doors closed. It had no consideration
for eleventh-hour repentances. As though they mattered
to life, or anything else! He could tell her something
now, of course, explain the psychology, let her know how
pathetically depressed and weary he had felt then. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
would she understand, care, forgive? She had been so
fond of him, done so much for him in her small, sweet way.
And yet, if she only knew, he could scarcely have helped
doing as he did then, so harried and depressed and eager for
advancement had he been, self-convinced of his own error
and failure before ever his life had a good start. If she could
only see how little all his later triumphs mattered now, how
much he would be glad to do for her now! if only—only—he
could. Well, he must quit these thoughts. They did not
help at all, nor his coming out here and feeling this way!</p>

<p>But life was so automatic and unconsciously cruel at
times. One’s disposition drove one so, shutting and bolting
doors behind one, driving one on and on like a harried steer
up a narrow runway to one’s fate. He could have been
happy right here with Marie and the children—as much so
as he had ever been since. Or, if he had only taken Marie
along, once the little ones were gone—they might have been
happy enough together. They might have been! But no,
no; something in him at that time would not let him.
Really, he was a victim of his own grim impulses, dreams,
passions, mad and illogical as that might seem. He was
crazy for success, wild with a desire for a superior, contemptuous
position in the world. People were so, at times.
He had been. He had had to do as he did, so horribly
would he have suffered mentally if he had not, all the theories
of the moralists to the contrary notwithstanding. The
notions of one’s youth were not necessarily those of age, and
that was why he was here to-day in this very gloomy and
contrite mood.</p>

<p>He went around the corner now to the side entrance of
the old apartment house, and paused. For there, down the
street, almost—not quite—as he had left it, was the residence
of the quondam old Abijah Hargot, he of the pigeons,—iron
manufacturer and Presbyterian, who even in his day was
living there in spite of the fact that the truly princely residence
suburbs had long since moved much farther out and
he was being entirely surrounded by an element of cheaper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
life which could not have been exactly pleasant to him. In
those days he and Marie had heard of the hardwood floors,
the great chandeliers, the rugs and pictures of the house
that had once faced a wide sward leading down to the river’s
edge itself. But look at it now! A lumber-yard between it
and the river! And some sort of a small shop or factory on
this end of the lawn! And in his day, Abijah had kept a
pet Jersey cow nibbling the grass under the trees and fantailed
pigeons on the slate roof of his barn, at the corner
where now was this small factory, and at the back of his
house an immense patch of golden glow just outside the conservatory
facing the east, and also two pagodas down near
the river. But all gone! all gone, or nearly so. Just the
house and a part of the lawn. And occupied now by whom?
In the old days he had never dared dream, or scarcely so, that
some day, years later—when he would be much older and
sadder, really, and haunted by the ghosts of these very
things—he would be able to return here and know that he
had far more imposing toys than old Hargot had ever
dreamed of, as rich as he was.</p>

<p>Toys!</p>

<p>Toys!</p>

<p>Yes, they were toys, for one played with them a little
while, as with so many things, and then laid them aside
forever.</p>

<p>Toys!</p>

<p>Toys!</p>

<p>But then, as he had since come to know, old Hargot had
not been without his troubles, in spite of all his money. For,
as rumor had it then, his oldest son, Lucien, his pride, in
those days, a slim, artistic type of boy, had turned out a
drunkard, gambler, night-life lover; had run with women,
become afflicted with all sorts of ills, and after his father had
cut him off and driven him out (refusing to permit him
even to visit the home), had hung about here, so the neighbors
had said, and stolen in to see his mother, especially on
dark or rainy nights, in order to get aid from her. And,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
like all mothers, she had aided him secretly, or so they said,
in spite of her fear of her husband. Mothers were like that—his
mother, too. Neighbors testified that they had seen
her whispering to him in the shade of the trees of the lawn
or around the corner in the next street—a sad, brooding,
care-worn woman, always in black or dark blue. Yes, life
held its disappointments for every one, of course, even old
Abijah and himself.</p>

<p>He went on to the door and paused, wondering whether
to go up or not, for the atmosphere of this building and
this neighborhood was very, very sad now, very redolent of
old, sweet, dead and half-forgotten things. The river there,
running so freshly at the foot of the street; the school where
the children used to play and shout, while he worked on
certain idle days when there was no work at the factory;
the little church up the street to which so many commonplace
adherents used to make their way on Sunday; the
shabby cabin of the plumber farther up this same street,
who used to go tearing off every Saturday and Sunday in a
rattle-trap car which he had bought second-hand and which
squeaked and groaned, for all the expert repairing he had
been able to do upon it.</p>

<p>The color, the humor, the sunshine of those old first
days, in spite of their poverty!</p>

<p>He hesitated as to whether to ring the bell or no—just
as he and Marie had, twenty-odd years before. She was so
gay then, so hopeful, so all-unconscious of the rough fate
that was in store for her here.... How would it be inside?
Would Marie’s little gas stove still be near the window
in the combined kitchen, dining-room and laundry—almost
general living-room—which that one room was?
Would the thin single gas jet still be hanging from the ceiling
over their small dining-room table (or the ghost of it)
where so often after their meals, to save heat in the other
room—because there was no heat in the alleged radiator, and
their oil stove cost money—he had sat and read or worked
on plans of some of the things he hoped to perfect—and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
since, years since, but long after he had left her and this
place? How sad! He had never had one touch of luck or
opportunity with her here,—not one. Yet, if only she could,
and without pain because of it, know how brilliantly he had
finished some of them, how profitably they had resulted for
him if not her.</p>

<p>But he scarcely looked like one who would be wanting to
see so small an apartment, he now felt, tall and robust and
prosperous as he was. Still might he not be thinking
of buying this place? Or renting quarters for a servant or
a relative? Who should know? What difference did it
make? Why should he care?</p>

<p>He rang the bell, thinking of the small, stupid, unfriendly
and self-defensive woman who, twenty or more years before,
had come up from the basement below, wiping her hands on
a gingham apron and staring at them querulously. How
well he remembered her—and how unfriendly she had always
remained in spite of their efforts to be friendly, because
they had no tips to give her. She could not be here
any longer, of course; no, this one coming was unlike her in
everything except stupidity and grossness. But they were
alike in that, well enough. This one was heavy, beefy. She
would make almost two of the other one.</p>

<p>“The rooms,” he had almost said “apartment,” “on the
top floor—may I see them?”</p>

<p>“Dey are only t’ree an’ bat’—fourteen by der mont’.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he now added almost sadly. So they had
not raised the rent in all this time, although the city had
grown so. Evidently this region had become worse, not
better. “I’ll look at them, if you please, just the same,”
he went on, feeling that the dull face before him was wondering
why he should be looking at them at all.</p>

<p>“Vait; I getcha der key. You can go up py yerself.”</p>

<p>He might have known that she would never climb any
four flights save under compulsion.</p>

<p>She returned presently, and he made his way upward,
remembering how the fat husband of the former janitress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
had climbed up promptly every night at ten, if you please,
putting out the wee lights of gas on the return trip (all but
a thin flame on the second floor: orders from the landlord,
of course), and exclaiming as he did so, at each landing,
“Ach Gott, I go me up py der secon’ floor ant make me der
lights out. Ach Gott, I go me py der t’ird floor ant make
me der lights out. Ach Gott, I go me py der fourt’ floor ant
make me der lights out,” and so on until he reached the fifth,
where they lived. How often he had listened to him, puffing
and moaning as he came!</p>

<p>Yes, the yellowish-brown paper that they had abhorred
then, or one nearly as bad, covered all these hall walls to-day.
The stairs squeaked, just as they had then. The hall
gas jets were just as small and surmounted by shabby little
pink imitation glass candles—to give the place an air, no
doubt! He and Marie would never have taken this place
at all if it had depended on the hall, or if the views from
its little windows had not been so fine. In the old days
he had trudged up these steps many a night, winter and
summer, listening, as he came, for sounds of Marie in the
kitchen, for the prattle of the two children after they were
with them, for the glow of a friendly light (always shining
at six in winter) under the door and through the keyhole.
His light! His door! In those early dark winter days,
when he was working so far downtown and coming home
this way regularly, Marie, at the sound of his key in the
lock, would always come running, her heavy black hair
done in a neat braid about her brow, her trim little figure
buttoned gracefully into a house-dress of her own making.
And she always had a smile and a “Hello, dearie; back
again?” no matter how bad things were with them, how
lean the little larder or the family purse. Poor little Marie!</p>

<p>It all came back to him now as he trudged up the stairs
and neared the door. God!</p>

<p>And here was the very door, unchanged—yellow, painted
to imitate the natural grain of oak, but the job having
turned out a dismal failure as he had noted years before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
And the very lock the same! Could he believe? Scarcely
any doubt of it. For here was that other old hole, stuffed
with putty and painted over, which he and Marie had noted
as being the scar of some other kind of a lock or knob that
had preceded this one. And still stuffed with paper! Marie
had thought burglars (!) might make their way in via that,
and he had laughed to think what they would steal if they
should. Poor little Marie!</p>

<p>But now, now—well, here he was all alone, twenty-four
years later, Marie and Peter and Frank gone this long time,
and he the master of so many men and so much power and
so much important property. What was life, anyhow?
What was it?</p>

<p>Ghosts! Ghosts!</p>

<p>Were there ghosts?</p>

<p>Did spirits sometimes return and live and dream over old,
sad scenes such as this? Could Marie? Would she? Did
she?</p>

<p>Oh, Marie!... Marie! Poor little weak, storm-beaten,
life-beaten soul. And he the storm, really.</p>

<p>Well, here was the inside now, and things were not a bit
different from what they had been in his and her day, when
they had both been so poor. No, just the same. The floor
a little more nail-marked, perhaps, especially in the kitchen
here, where no doubt family after family had tacked down
oil-cloth in place of other pieces taken up—theirs, for instance.
And here in the parlor—save the mark!—the paper
as violent as it had ever been! Such paper—red, with great
bowls of pinkish flowers arranged in orderly rows! But
then they were paying so little rent that it was ridiculous
for them to suggest that they wanted anything changed.
The landlord would not have changed it anyhow.</p>

<p>And here on the west wall, between the two windows,
overlooking Abijah Hargot’s home and the river and the
creeping city beyond, was where he had hung a wretched
little picture, a print of an etching of a waterscape which
he had admired so much in those days and had bought somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
second-hand for a dollar—a house on an inlet near
the sea, such a house as he would have liked to have occupied,
or thought he would—then. Ah, these windows!
The northernmost one had always been preferred by him
and her because of the sweep of view west and north. And
how often he had stood looking at a soft, or bleak, or reddening,
sunset over the river; or, of an early night in
winter, at the lights on the water below. And the outpost
apartments and homes of the great city beyond. Life had
looked very dark then, indeed. At times, looking, he had
been very sad. He was like some brooding Hamlet of an
inventor as he stood there then gazing at the sweet little
river, the twinkling stars in a steely black sky overhead;
or, in the fall when it was still light, some cold red island
of a cloud in the sky over the river and the city, and wondering
what was to become of him—what was in store for
him! The fallacy of such memories as these! Their
futility!</p>

<p>But things had dragged and dragged—here! In spite of
the fact that his mind was full of inventions, inventions,
inventions, and methods of applying them in some general
way which would earn him money, place, fame—as they
subsequently did—the strange mysteries of ionic or electronic
action, for instance, of motion, of attraction and polarity, of
wave lengths and tensile strengths and adhesions in metals,
woods and materials of all kinds—his apparent error in
putting himself in a position where failure might come to
him had so preyed on his mind here, that he could do
nothing. He could only dream, and do common, ordinary
day labor—skeleton wiring and insulating, for instance,
electrical mapping, and the like. Again, later, but while still
here, since he had been reading, reading, reading after marriage,
and working and thinking, life had gone off into a
kind of welter of conflicting and yet organized and plainly
directed powers which was confusing to him, which was not
to be explained by anything man could think of and which
no inventor had as yet fully used, however great he was—Edison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Kelvin, or Bell. Everything as he knew then and
hoped to make use of in some way was alive, everything
full of force, even so-called dead or decaying things. Life
was force, that strange, seemingly (at times) intelligent
thing, and there was apparently nothing but force—everywhere—amazing,
perfect, indestructible. (He had thought
of all that here in this little room and on the roof overhead
where he made some of his experiments, watching old Hargot’s
pigeons flying about the sky, the sound of their wings
coming so close at times that they were like a whisper of the
waves of the sea, dreams in themselves.)</p>

<p>But the little boundaries of so-called health and decay,
strength and weakness, as well as all alleged <em>fixity</em> or changelessness
of things,—how he had brooded on all that, at that
time. And how all thought of fixity in anything had disappeared
as a ridiculous illusion intended, maybe, by something
to fool man into the belief that his world here, his
physical and mental state, was real and enduring, a greater
thing than anything else in the universe, when so plainly it
was not. But not himself. A mere shadow—an illusion—nothing.
On this little roof, here, sitting alone at night
or by day in pleasant weather or gray, Saturdays and
Sundays when it was warm and because they had no money
and no particular place to go, and looking at the stars or
the lights of the city or the sun shining on the waters of
the little river below,—he had thought of all this. It had all
come to him, the evanescence of everything, its slippery,
protean changefulness. Everything was alive, and everything
was nothing, in so far as its seeming reality was
concerned. And yet everything was everything but still
capable of being undermined, changed, improved, or come
at in some hitherto undreamed-of way—even by so humble
a creature as himself, an inventor—and used as chained
force, if only one knew how. And that was why he had
become a great inventor since—because he had thought so—had
chained force and used it—even he. He had become
conscious of anterior as well as ulterior forces and immensities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
and fathomless wells of wisdom and energy, and had
enslaved a minute portion of them, that was all. But not
here! Oh, no. Later!</p>

<p>The sad part of it, as he thought of it now, was that
poor little Marie could not have understood a thing of all
he was thinking, even if he had explained and explained,
as he never attempted to do. Life was all a mystery to
Marie—deep, dark, strange—as it was to him, only he
was seeking and she was not. Sufficient to her to be near
him, loving him in her simple, dumb way, not seeking to
understand. Even then he had realized that and begun to
condemn her for it in his mind, to feel that she was no real
aid and could never be—just a mother-girl, a housewife, a
social fixture, a cook, destined to be shoved back if ever he
were really successful; and that was sad even then, however
obviously true.</p>

<p>But to her, apparently, he was so much more than just
a mere man—a god, really, a dream, a beau, a most wonderful
person, dreaming strange dreams and thinking strange
thoughts which would lead him heaven knows where; how
high or how strange, though, she could never guess, nor even
he then. And for that very reason—her blind, non-understanding
adoration—she had bored him then, horribly at
times. All that he could think of then, as he looked at
her at times—after the first year or two or three, when the
novelty of her physical beauty and charm had worn off
and the children had come, and cares and worries due to
his non-success were upon them—was that she was an honest,
faithful, patient, adoring little drudge, but no more,
and that was all she would ever be. Think of that!
That was the way life was—the way it rewarded love!
He had not begun to dislike her—no, that was not
it—but it was because, as the philosopher had said, that in
and through her and the babies he had given hostages to
fortune, and that she was not exactly the type of woman
who could further him as fast as he wished—that he had
begun to weary of her. And that was practically the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
base of his objection to her,—not anything she did.</p>

<p>Yes, yes—it was that, <em>that</em>, that had begun to plague him
as though he had consciously fastened a ball and chain on
one foot and now never any more could walk quickly or
well or be really free. Instead of being able to think on
his inventions he was constantly being compelled to think
on how he would make a living for her and them, or find
ten more dollars, or get a new dress for Marie and shoes
for the children! Or how increase his salary. That was
the great and enduring problem all the time, and over and
over here. Although healthy, vigorous and savagely ambitious,
at that time, it was precisely because he was those
things that he had rebelled so and had desired to be free.
He was too strong and fretful as he could see now to endure
so mean a life. It was that that had made him savage,
curt, remote, indifferent so much of the time in these later
days—here— And to her. And when she could not help
it at all—poor little thing—did not know how to help it
and had never asked him to marry her! Life had tinkled
so in his ears then. It had called and called. And essentially,
in his own eyes then, he was as much of a failure as
a husband as he was at his work, and that was killing him.
His mind had been too steadily depressed by his mistake in
getting married, in having children so soon, as well as by
his growing knowledge of what he might be fitted to do if
only he had a chance to go off to a big technical school
somewhere and work his way through alone and so get a
new and better position somewhere else—to have a change
of scene. For once, as he knew then, and with all his ideas,
he was technically fitted for his work, with new light and
experience in his mind, what wonders might he not accomplish!
Sitting in this little room, or working or dreaming
upstairs in the air, how often he had thought of all that!</p>

<p>But no; nothing happened for ever so long here. Days
and weeks and months, and even years went by without
perceptible change. Nature seemed to take a vicious delight
in torturing him, then, in so far as his dreams were concerned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
his hopes. Hard times came to America, blasting
ones—a year and a half of panic really—in which every one
hung on to his pathetic little place, and even he was afraid
to relinquish the meagre one he had, let alone ask for more
pay. At the same time his dreams, the passing of his youth,
this unconscionable burden of a family, tortured him more
and more. Marie did not seem to mind anything much, so
long as she was with him. She suffered, of course, but more
for him than for herself, for his unrest, and his dissatisfaction,
which she feared. Would he ever leave her? Was he
becoming unhappy with her? Her eyes so often asked what
her lips feared to frame.</p>

<p>Once they had seventy dollars saved toward some inventive
work of his. But then little Peter fell from the top
of the washtub, where he had climbed for some reason, and
broke his arm. Before it was healed and all the bills paid,
the seventy was gone. Another time Marie’s mother was
dying, or so she thought, and she had to go back home and
help her father and brother in their loneliness. Again, it was
brother George who, broke, arrived from Philadelphia and
lived with them a while because he had no place else to go.
Also once he thought to better himself by leaving the International
Electric, and joining the Winston Castro Generator
Company. But when he had left the first, the manager of
the second, to whom he had applied and by whom he had
been engaged, was discharged (“let out,” as he phrased it),
and the succeeding man did not want him. So for three
long months he had been without anything, and, like Job,
finally, he had been ready to curse God and die.</p>

<p>And then—right here in these rooms it was—he had
rebelled, spiritually, as he now recalled, and had said to
himself that he could not stand this any longer, that he was
ruining his life, and that however much it might torture
Marie—ruin her even—he must leave and do something to
better his state. Yes quite definitely, once and for all, then,
he had wished that he had not married Marie, that they had
never been so foolish as to have children, that Marie was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
not dependent on him any more, that he was free to go,
be, do, all the things he felt that he could go do, be—no
matter where, so long as he went and was free. Yes, he
had wished that in a violent, rebellious, prayerful way, and
then—</p>

<p>Of all the winters of his life, the one that followed that
was the blackest and bleakest, that last one with Marie. It
seemed to bring absolutely nothing to either him or her or
the children save disaster. Twenty-five dollars was all he
had ever been able to make, apparently, while he was with
her. The children were growing and constantly requiring
more; Marie needed many things, and was skimping along
on God knows what. Once she had made herself some
corset slips and other things out of his cast-off underwear—bad
as that was! And then once, when he was crossing
Chadds Bridge, just below here, and had paused to meditate
and dream, a new hat—his very best, needless to say, for he
had worn his old one until it was quite gone—had blown off
into the water, a swift wind and some bundles he was compelled
to carry home aiding, and had been swiftly carried out
by the tide. So much had he been harried in those days by
one thing and another that at first he had not even raged,
although he was accustomed so to do. Instead then he had
just shut his teeth and trudged on in the biting wind, in
danger of taking cold and dying of something or other—as
he had thought at the time—only then he had said to himself
that he did not really mind now. What difference did
it make to himself or anybody whether he died or not?
Did anybody care really, God or anybody else, what became
of him? Supposing he did it? What of it? Could it be
any worse than this? To hell with life itself, and its
Maker,—this brutal buffeting of winds and cold and harrying
hungers and jealousies and fears and brutalities, arranged
to drive and make miserable these crawling, beggarly
creatures—men! Why, what had he ever had of God or
any creative force so far? What had God ever done for
him or his life, or his wife and children?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>So he had defiantly raged.</p>

<p>And then life—or God, or what you will—had seemed
to strike at last. It was as if some Jinnee of humane or
inhuman power had said, “Very well, then, since you are
so dissatisfied and unhappy, so unworthy of all this (perhaps)
that I have given you, you shall have your will, your
dreams. You have prayed to be free. Even so—this thing
that you see here now shall pass away. You have sinned
against love and faith in your thoughts. You shall be free!
Look! Behold! You shall be! Your dreams shall come
true!”</p>

<p>And then, at once, as if in answer to this command of
the Jinnee, as though, for instance, it had waved its hand,
the final storm began which blew everything quite away.
Fate struck. It was as if black angels had entered and
stationed themselves at his doors and windows, armed with
the swords of destruction, of death. Harpies and furies
beset his path and perched on his roof. One night—it was
a month before Peter and Frank died, only three days before
they contracted their final illness—he was crossing this same
bridge below here and was speculating, as usual, as to his
life and his future, when suddenly, in spite of the wind
and cold and some dust flying from a coal barge below, his
eye was attracted by two lights which seemed to come dancing
down the hill from the direction of his apartment and
passed out over the river. They rose to cross over the
bridge in front of him and disappeared on the other side.
They came so close they seemed almost to brush his face,
and yet he could not quite accept them as real. There was
something too eerie about them. From the moment he first
laid eyes on them in the distance they seemed strange. They
came so easily, gracefully, and went so. From the first
moment he saw them there below Tegetmiller’s paint shop,
he wondered about them. What were they? What could
they mean? They were so bluish clear, like faint, grey
stars, so pale and watery. Suddenly it was as if something
whispered to him, “Behold! These are the souls of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
children. They are going—never to return! See! Your
prayers are being answered!”</p>

<p>And then it was that, struck with a kind of horror and
numb despair, he had hurried home, quite prepared to ask
Marie if the two boys were dead or if anything had happened
to them. But, finding them up and playing as usual
he had tried to put away all thought of this fact as a delusion,
to say nothing. But the lights haunted him. They
would not stay out of his mind. Would his boys really
die? Yet the first and the second day went without change.
But on the third both boys took sick, and he knew his dread
was well founded.</p>

<p>For on the instant, Marie was thrown into a deep, almost
inexplicable, depression, from which there was no arousing
her, although she attempted to conceal it from him by waiting
on and worrying over them. They had to put the
children in the one little bedroom (theirs), while they used
an extension cot in the “parlor,” previously occupied by the
children. Young Dr. Newton, the one physician of repute
in the neighborhood, was called in, and old Mrs. Wertzel,
the German woman in front, who, being old and lonely and
very fond of Marie, had volunteered her services. And so
they had weathered along, God only knows how. Marie
prepared the meals—or nearly all of them—as best she
could. He had gone to work each day, half in a dream,
wondering what the end was to be.</p>

<p>And then one night, as he and Marie were lying on the
cot pretending to sleep, he felt her crying. And taking her
in his arms he had tried to unwish all the dark things he
had wished, only apparently then it was too late. Something
told him it was. It was as though in some dark mansion
somewhere—some supernal court or hall of light or darkness—his
prayer had been registered and answered, a decision
made, and that that decision could not now be unmade.
No. Into this shabby little room where they lay and where
she was crying had come a final black emissary, scaled,
knightly, with immense arms and wings and a glittering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
sword, all black, and would not leave until all this should
go before him. Perhaps he had been a little deranged in
his mind at the time, but so it had seemed.</p>

<p>And then, just a few weeks after he had seen the lights
and a few days after Marie had cried so, Peter had died—poor
weak little thing that he was—and, three days later,
Frank. Those terrible hours! For by then he was feeling
so strange and sad and mystical about it all that he could
neither eat nor sleep nor weep nor work nor think. He
had gone about, as indeed had Marie, in a kind of stupor of
misery and despair. True, as he now told himself—and
then too, really,—he had not loved the children with all the
devotion he should have or he would never have had the
thoughts he had had—or so he had reasoned afterward.
Yet then as now he suffered because of the love he should
have given them, <em>and had not</em>—and now could not any
more, save in memory. He recalled how both boys looked
in those last sad days, their pinched little faces and small
weak hands! Marie was crushed, and yet dearer for the
time being than ever before. But the two children, once
gone, had seemed the victims of his own dark thoughts as
though his own angry, resentful wishes had slain them.
And so, for the time, his mood changed. He wished, if he
could, that he might undo it all, go on as before with Marie,
have other children to replace these lost ones in her affection—but
no. It was apparently not to be, not ever any more.</p>

<p>For, once they were gone, the cords which had held him
and Marie together were weaker, not stronger—almost
broken, really. For the charm which Marie had originally
had for him had mostly been merged in the vivacity and
vitality and interest of these two prattling curly-headed
boys. Despite the financial burden, the irritation and drain
they had been at times, they had also proved a binding chain,
a touch of sweetness in the relationship, a hope for the
future, a balance which had kept even this uneven scale.
With them present he had felt that however black the
situation it must endure because of them, their growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
interests; with them gone, it was rather plain that some
modification of their old state was possible—just how, for
the moment, he scarcely dared think or wish. It might be
that he could go away and study for awhile now. There
was no need of his staying here. The neighborhood was
too redolent now of the miseries they had endured. Alone
somewhere else, perhaps, he could collect his thoughts,
think out a new program. If he went away he might eventually
succeed in doing better by Marie. She could return
to her parents in Philadelphia for a little while and wait
for him, working there at something as she had before
until he was ready to send for her. The heavy load of
debts could wait until he was better able to pay them. In
the meantime, also, he could work and whatever he made
over and above his absolute necessities might go to her—or
to clearing off these debts.</p>

<p>So he had reasoned.</p>

<p>But it had not worked out so of course. No. In the
broken mood in which Marie then was it was not so easy.
Plainly, since he had run across her that April day in Philadelphia
when he was wiring for the great dry goods store,
her whole life had become identified with his, although his
had not become merged with hers. No. She was, and would
be, as he could so plainly see, then, nothing without him,
whereas he—he—Well, it had long since been plain that
he would be better off without her—materially, anyhow.
But what would she do if he stayed away a long time—or
never came back? What become? Had he thought of
that then? Yes, he had. He had even thought that once
away he might not feel like renewing this situation which
had proved so disastrous. And Marie had seemed to sense
that, too. She was so sad. True he had not thought of
all these things in any bold outright fashion then. Rather
they were as sly, evasive shadows skulking in the remote
recesses of his brain, things which scarcely dared show their
faces to the light, although later, once safely away—they
had come forth boldly enough. Only at that time, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
later—even now, he could not help feeling that however
much Marie might have lacked originally, or then, the
fault for their might was his,—that if he himself had not
been so dull in the first instance all these black things would
not have happened to him or to her. But could she go on
without him? Would she? he had asked himself then. And
answered that it would be better for him to leave and build
himself up in a different world, and then return and help
her later. So he fretted and reasoned.</p>

<p>But time had solved all that, too. In spite of the fact
that he could not help picturing her back there alone with
her parents in Philadelphia, their poor little cottage in
Leigh Street in which she and her parents had lived—not
a cottage either, but a minute little brick pigeon-hole in one
of those long lines of red, treeless, smoky barracks flanking
the great mills of what was known as the Reffington District,
where her father worked—he had gone. He had
asked himself what would she be doing there? What
thinking, all alone without him—the babies dead? But he
had gone.</p>

<p>He recalled so well the day he left her—she to go to
Philadelphia, he to Boston, presumably—the tears, the depression,
the unbelievable sadness in her soul and his. Did
she suspect? Did she foreknow? She was so gentle, even
then, so trustful, so sad. “You will come back to me,
dearie, won’t you, soon?” she had said, and so sadly. “We
will be happy yet, won’t we?” she had asked between sobs.
And he had promised. Oh yes; he had done much promising
in his life, before and since. That was one of the
darkest things in his nature, his power of promising.</p>

<p>But had he kept that?</p>

<p>However much in after months and years he told himself
that he wanted to, that he must, that it was only fair,
decent, right, still he had not gone back. No. Other things
had come up with the passing of the days, weeks, months,
years, other forces, other interests. Some plan, person, desire
had always intervened, interfered, warned, counseled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
delayed. Were there such counselors? There had been
times during the first year when he had written her and sent
her a little money—money he had needed badly enough
himself. Later there was that long period in which he felt
that she must be getting along well enough, being with her
parents and at work, and he had not written. A second
woman had already appeared on the scene by then as a
friend. And then—</p>

<p>The months and years since then in which he had not
done so! After his college course—which he took up after
he left Marie, working his way—he had left Boston and
gone to K—— to begin a career as an assistant plant manager
and a developer of ideas of his own, selling the rights
to such things as he invented to the great company with
which he was connected. And then it was that by degrees
the idea of a complete independence and a much greater life
had occurred to him. He found himself so strong, so interesting
to others. Why not be free, once and for all? Why
not grow greater? Why not go forward and work out all
the things about which he had dreamed? The thing from
which he had extricated himself was too confining, too
narrow. It would not do to return. The old shell could
not now contain him. Despite her tenderness, Marie was
not significant enough. So—He had already seen so
much that he could do, be, new faces, a new world, women
of a higher social level.</p>

<p>But even so, the pathetic little letters which still followed
from time to time—not addressed to him in his new world
(she did not know where he was), but to him in the old
one—saying how dearly she loved him, how she still awaited
his return, that she knew he was having a hard time, that
she prayed always, and that all would come out right yet,
that they would be able to be together yet!—she was working,
saving, praying for him! True, he had the excuse that
for the first four years he had not really made anything
much, but still he might have done something for her,—might
he not have?—gone back, persuaded her to let him go,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
made her comfortable, brought her somewhat nearer him
even? Instead he had feared, feared, reasoned, argued.</p>

<p>Yes, the then devil of his nature, his ambition, had held
him completely. He was seeing too clearly the wonder of
what he might be, and soon, what he was already becoming.
Everything as he argued then and saw now would have
had to be pushed aside for Marie, whereas what he really
desired was that his great career, his greater days, his
fame, the thing he was sure to be now—should push everything
aside. And so—Perhaps he had become sharper,
colder, harder, than he had ever been, quite ready to sacrifice
everything and everybody, or nearly, until he should be
the great success he meant to be. But long before this he
might have done so much. And he had not—had not until
very recently decided to revisit this older, sweeter world.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, as he had long since learned, how
the tragedy of her life had been completed. All at once
in those earlier years all letters had ceased, and time slipping
by—ten years really—he had begun to grow curious. Writing
back to a neighbor of hers in Philadelphia in a disguised
hand and on nameless paper, he had learned that nearly two
years before her father had died and that she and her mother
and brother had moved away, the writer could not say
where. Then, five years later, when he was becoming truly
prosperous, he had learned, through a detective agency, that
she and her mother and her ne’er-do-well brother had moved
back into this very neighborhood—this old neighborhood of
his and hers!—or, rather, a little farther out near the graveyard
where their two boys were buried. The simplicity of
her! The untutored homing instinct!</p>

<p>But once here, according to what he had learned recently,
she and her mother had not prospered at all. They had
occupied the most minute of apartments farther out, and
had finally been compelled to work in a laundry in their
efforts to get along—and he was already so well-to-do,
wealthy, really! Indeed three years before his detectives
had arrived, her mother had died, and two years after that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
she herself, of pneumonia, as had their children. Was it a
message from her that had made him worry at that time?
Was that why, only six months since, although married
and rich and with two daughters by this later marriage,
he had not been able to rest until he had found this out,
returned here now to see? Did ghosts still stalk the world?</p>

<p>Yes, to-day he had come back here, but only to realize
once and for all now how futile this errand was, how cruel
he had been, how dreary her latter days must have been in
this poor, out-of-the-way corner where once, for a while at
least, she had been happy—he and she.</p>

<p>“Been happy!”</p>

<p>“By God,” he suddenly exclaimed, a passion of self-reproach
and memory overcoming him, “I can’t stand this!
It was not right, not fair. I should not have waited so long.
I should have acted long, long since. The cruelty—the
evil! There is something cruel and evil in it all, in all
wealth, all ambition, in love of fame—too cruel. I must
get out! I must think no more—see no more.”</p>

<p>And hurrying to the door and down the squeaking stairs,
he walked swiftly back to the costly car that was waiting
for him a few blocks below the bridge—that car which was
so representative of the realm of so-called power and success
of which he was now the master—that realm which,
for so long, had taken its meaningless lustre from all that
had here preceded it—the misery, the loneliness, the shadow,
the despair. And in it he was whirled swiftly and gloomily
away.</p>

PHANTOM GOLD</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">You</span> would have to have seen it to have gathered a
true impression—the stubby roughness of the country,
the rocks, the poverty of the soil, the poorness of the houses,
barns, agricultural implements, horses and cattle and even
human beings, in consequence—especially human beings, for
why should they, any more than any other product of the
soil, flourish where all else was so poor?</p>

<p>It was old Judge Blow who first discovered that “Jack,”
or zinc, was the real riches of Taney, if it could be said
to have had any before “Jack” was discovered. Months
before the boom began he had stood beside a smelter in far-off
K—— one late winter afternoon and examined with a
great deal of care the ore which the men were smelting,
marveling at its resemblance to certain rocks or boulders
known as “slug lumps” in his home county.</p>

<p>“What is this stuff?” he asked of one of the bare-armed
men who came out from the blazing furnace after a time to
wipe his dripping face.</p>

<p>“Zinc,” returned the other, as he passed his huge, soiled
palm over his forehead.</p>

<p>“We have stuff down in our county that looks like that,”
said the judge as he turned the dull-looking lump over and
considered for a while. “I’m sure of it—any amount.”
Then he became suddenly silent, for a thought struck
him.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s really ‘Jack,’” said the workman, using the
trade or mining name for it, “there’s money in it, all right.
This here comes from St. Francis.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>The old judge thought of this for a little while and
quietly turned away. He knew where St. Francis was. If
this was so valuable that they could ship it all the way
from southeast B——, why not from Taney? Had he
not many holdings in Taney?</p>

<p>The result was that before long a marked if secret change
began to manifest itself in Taney and regions adjacent
thereto. Following the private manipulations and goings to
and fro of the judge one or two shrewd prospectors appeared,
and then after a time the whole land was rife
with them. But before that came to pass many a farmer
who had remained in ignorance of the value of his holdings
was rifled of them.</p>

<p>Old Bursay Queeder, farmer and local ne’er-do-well in
the agricultural line, had lived on his particular estate or
farm for forty years, and at the time that Judge Blow was
thus mysteriously proceeding to and fro and here and there
upon the earth, did not know that the rocks against which
his pair of extra large feet were being regularly and bitterly
stubbed contained the very wealth of which he had been idly
and rather wistfully dreaming all his life. Indeed, the
earth was a very mysterious thing to Bursay, containing, as
it did, everything he really did not know. This collection
of seventy acres, for instance—which individually and
collectively had wrung more sweat from his brow and
more curses from his lips than anything else ever had—contained,
unknown to him, the possibility of the fulfilment
of all his dreams. But he was old now and a little
queer in the head at times, having notions in regard to the
Bible, when the world would come to an end, and the like,
although still able to contend with nature, if not with
man. Each day in the spring and summer and even fall
seasons he could be seen on some portion or other of his
barren acres, his stubby beard and sparse hair standing out
roughly, his fingers like a bird’s claws clutching his plough
handles, turning the thin and meagre furrows of his fields
and rattling the stony soil, which had long ceased to yield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
him even a modicum of profit. It was a bare living now
which he expected, and a bare living which he received.
The house, or cabin, which he occupied with his wife and
son and daughter, was dilapidated beyond the use or even
need of care. The fences were all decayed save for those
which had been built of these same impediments of the soil
which he had always considered a queer kind of stone, useless
to man or beast—a “hendrance,” as he would have said.
His barn was a mere accumulation of patchboards, shielding
an old wagon and some few scraps of machinery. And the
alleged corn crib was so aged and lopsided that it was
ready to fall. Weeds and desolation, bony horses and as
bony children, stony fields and thin trees, and withal solitude
and occasional want—such was the world of his care
and his ruling.</p>

<p>Mrs. Queeder was a fitting mate for the life to which
he was doomed. It had come to that pass with her that
the monotony of deprivation was accepted with indifference.
The absence or remoteness of even a single modest school,
meeting house or town hall, to say nothing of convenient
neighbors, had left her and hers all but isolated. She was
irascible, cantankerous, peculiar; her voice was shrill and
her appearance desolate. Queeder, whom she understood
or misunderstood thoroughly, was a source of comfort in
one way—she could “nag at him,” as he said, and if they
quarreled frequently it was in a fitting and harmonious way.
Amid such a rattletrap of fields and fences bickering was to
be expected.</p>

<p>“Why don’t yuh take them thar slug lumps an’ make a
fence over thar?” she asked of Queeder for something like
the thousandth time in ten years, referring to as many as
thirty-five piles of the best and almost pure zinc lying along
the edges of the nearest field, and piled there by Bursay,—this
time because two bony cows had invaded one of their
corn patches. The “slug lumps” to which she referred
could not have been worth less than $2,000.</p>

<p>For as many as the thousandth time he had replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Well, fer the land sakes, hain’t I never got nuthin’ else
tuh do? Yuh’d think them thar blame-ding rocks wuz
wuth more nor anythin’ else. I do well enough ez ’tis to
git ’em outen the sile, I say, ‘thout tryin’ tuh make fences
outen ’em.”</p>

<p>“So yuh say—yuh lazy, good-fer-nuthin’ ole tobacco-chewin’ ——,”
here a long list of expletives which was
usually succeeded by a stove lid or poker or a fair-sized
stick of wood, propelled by one party or the other, and
which was as deftly dodged. Love and family affection,
you see, due to unbroken and unbreakable propinquity, as
it were.</p>

<p>But to proceed: The hot and rainy seasons had come
and gone in monotonous succession during a period of years,
and the lumps still lay in the field. Dode, the eldest child
and only son—a huge, hulking, rugged and yet bony ignoramus,
who had not inherited an especially delicate or
agreeable disposition from his harried parents—might have
removed them had he not been a “consarned lazy houn’,”
his father said, or like his father, as his mother said, and
Jane, the daughter, might have helped, but these two partook
of the same depressed indifference which characterized
the father. And why not, pray? They had worked long,
had had little, seen less and hoped for no particular outlet
for their lives in the future, having sense enough to know
that if fate had been more kind there might have been.
Useless contention with an unyielding soil had done its best
at hardening their spirits.</p>

<p>“I don’t see no use ploughin’ the south patch,” Dode had
now remarked for the third time this spring. “The blamed
thing don’t grow nuthin’.”</p>

<p>“Ef yuh only half ’tended it instid o’ settin’ out thar
under them thar junipers pickin’ yer teeth an’ meditatin’,
mebbe ’twould,” squeaked Mrs. Queeder, always petulant
or angry or waspish—a nature soured by long and hopeless
and useless contention.</p>

<p>“No use shakin’ up a lot uv rocks, ez I see,” returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Dode, wearily and aimlessly slapping at a fly. “The hull
place ain’t wuth a hill o’ beans,” and from one point of
view he was right.</p>

<p>“Why don’t yuh git off’n hit then?” suggested Queeder
in a tantalizing voice, with no particular desire to defend
the farm, merely with an idle wish to vary the monotony.
“Ef hit’s good enough tuh s’port yuh, hit’s good enough to
work on, I say.”</p>

<p>“S’port!” sniffed the undutiful Dode, wearily, and yet
humorously and scornfully. “I ain’t seed much s’port, ez
I kin remember. Mebbe ye’re thinkin’ uv all the fine
schoolin’ I’ve had, er the places I’ve been.” He slapped at
another fly.</p>

<p>Old Queeder felt the sneer, but as he saw it it was
scarcely his fault. He had worked. At the same time he
felt the futility of quarreling with Dode, who was younger
and stronger and no longer, owing to many family quarrels,
bearing him any filial respect. As a matter of fact it was
the other way about. From having endured many cuffs and
blows in his youth Dode was now much the more powerful
physically, and in any contest could easily outdo his father;
and Queeder, from at first having ruled and seen his word
law, was now compelled to take second, even third and
fourth, place, and by contention and all but useless snarling
gain the very little consideration that he received.</p>

<p>But in spite of all this they lived together indifferently.
And day after day—once Judge Blow had returned to Taney—time
was bringing nearer and nearer the tide of mining
and the amazing boom that went with it. Indeed every
day, like a gathering storm cloud, it might have been noted
by the sensitive as approaching closer and closer, only these
unwitting holders were not sensitive. They had not the
slightest inkling as yet of all that was to be. Here in this
roadless, townless region how was one to know. Prospectors
passed to the north and the south of them; but as yet none
had ever come directly to this wonderful patch upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
which Queeder and his family rested. It was in too out-of-the-way
a place—a briary, woodsy, rocky corner.</p>

<p>Then one sunny June morning—</p>

<p>“Hi, thar!” called Cal Arnold, their next neighbor, who
lived some three miles further on, who now halted his
rickety wagon and bony horses along the road opposite the
field in which Queeder was working. “Hyur the news?”
He spoke briskly, shifting his cud of tobacco and eyeing
Queeder with the chirpiness of one who brings diverting
information.</p>

<p>“No; what?” asked Queeder, ceasing his “cultivating”
with a worn one-share plough and coming over and leaning
on his zinc fence, rubbing a hand through his sparse hair
the while.</p>

<p>“Ol’ Dunk Porter down here to Newton’s sold his farm,”
replied Cal, shrewdly and jubilantly, as though he were
relating the tale of a great battle or the suspected approach
of the end of the world. “An’ he got three thousan’ dollars
fer it.” He rolled the sum deliciously under his tongue.</p>

<p>“Yuh don’t say!” said Queeder quietly but with profound
and amazed astonishment. “Three thousan’?” He
stirred as one who hears of the impossible being accomplished
and knows it can’t be true. “Whut fer?”</p>

<p>“They ’low now ez how thar’s min’l onto it,” went on
the farmer wisely. “They ’low ez how now this hyur hull
kentry round hyur is thick an’ spilin’ with it. Hit’s uvrywhar.
They tell me ez how these hyur slug lumps”—and
he flicked at one of the large piles of hitherto worthless
zinc against which Queeder was leaning—“is this hyur
min’l—er ‘Jack,’ ez they call hit—an’ that hit’s wuth two
cents a pound when it’s swelted” (“smelted,” he meant)
“an’ even more. I see yuh got quite a bit uv hit. So’ve I.
Thar’s a lot layin’ down around my place. I allus ’lowed
ez how ’twant wuth much o’ anythin,’ but they say ’tis. I
hyur from some o’ the boys ’at’s been to K—— that when
hit’s fixed up, swelted and like o’ that, that hit’s good fer
lots of things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>He did not know what exactly, so he did not stop to
explain. Instead he cocked a dreamful eye, screwed up his
mouth preparatory to expectorating and looked at Queeder.
The latter, unable to adjust his thoughts to this new situation,
picked up a piece of the hitherto despised “slug” and
looked at it. To think that through all these years of toil
and suffering he should have believed it worthless and now
all of a sudden it was worth two cents a pound when
“swelted” and that neighbors were beginning to sell their
farms for princely sums!—and his farm was covered with
this stuff, this gold almost! Why, there were whole hummocks
of it raising slaty-gray backs to the hot sun further
on, a low wall in one place where it rose sheer out of the
ground on this “prupetty,” as he always referred to it.
Think of that! Think of that! But although he thought
much he said nothing, for in his starved and hungry brain
was beginning to sprout and flourish a great and wondrous
idea. He was to have money, wealth—ease, no less! Think
of it! Not to toil and sweat in the summer sun any more,
to loaf and dream at his ease, chew all the tobacco he wished,
live in town, visit far-off, mysterious K——, see all there
was to see!</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll be drivin’ on,” commented Arnold
after a time, noting Queeder’s marked abstraction. “I cal’late
tuh git over tuh Bruder’s an’ back by sundown. He’s
got a little hay I traded him a pig fer hyur a while back,”
and he flicked his two bony horses and was off up the
rubbly, dusty road.</p>

<p>For a time Queeder was scarcely satisfied to believe his
senses. Was it really true? Had Porter really sold his
place? For days thereafter, although he drove to Arno—sixteen
miles away—to discover the real truth, he held his
own counsel, nursing a wonderful fancy. This property
was his, not his wife’s, nor his two children’s. Years
before he had worked and paid for it, a few lone dollars
at a time, or their equivalent in corn, pigs, wheat, before he
had married. Now—now—soon one of those strange creatures—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
“prowspector,” Arnold had called him—who went
about with money would come along and buy up his property.
Wonderful! Wonderful! What would he get
for it?—surely five thousand dollars, considering that Porter
had received three for forty acres, whereas he had
seventy. Four thousand, anyhow—a little more than Dunk.
He could not figure it very well, but it would be more than
Dunk’s, whatever it was—probably five thousand!</p>

<p>The one flaw in all this though—and it was a great flaw—was
the thought of his savage and unkindly family—the recalcitrant
Dode, the angular Jane and his sour better half,
Emma—who would now probably have to share in all
this marvelous prosperity, might even take it away from
him and push him into that background where he had been
for so long. They were so much more dogmatic, forceful
than he. He was getting old, feeble even, from long years
of toil. His wife had done little this long time but sneer
and jeer at him, as he now chose most emphatically to remember;
his savage son the same. Jane, the indifferent,
who looked on him as a failure and a ne’er-do-well, had
done nothing but suggest that he work harder. Love,
family tenderness, family unity—if these had ever existed
they had long since withered in the thin, unnourishing air
of this rough, poverty-stricken world. What did he owe
any of them? Nothing. And now they would want to
share in all this, of course. Having lived so long with them,
and under such disagreeable conditions, he now wondered
how they would dare suggest as much, and still he knew they
would. Fight him, nag him, that’s all they had ever done.
But now that wealth was at his door they would be running
after him, fawning upon him—demanding it of him,
perhaps! What should he do? How arrange for all of
this?—for wealth was surely close to his hands. It must
be. Like a small, half-intelligent rat he peeked and perked.
His demeanor changed to such an extent that even his family
noticed it and began to wonder, although (knowing nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
of all that had transpired as yet) they laid it to the
increasing queerness of age.</p>

<p>“Have yuh noticed how Pap acts these hyur days?” Dode
inquired of Jane and his mother one noontime after old
Queeder had eaten and returned to the fields. “He’s all the
time standin’ out thar at the fence lookin’ aroun’ ez if he wuz
a-waitin’ fer somebody er thinkin’ about somepin. Mebbe
he’s gittin’ a little queer, huh? Y’ think so?”</p>

<p>Dode was most interested in anything which concerned
his father—or, rather, his physical or mental future—for
once he died this place would have to be divided or he be
called upon to run it, and in that case he would be a fitting
catch for any neighborhood farming maiden, and as such
able to broach and carry through the long-cherished dream of
matrimony, now attenuated and made all but impossible by
the grinding necessities he was compelled to endure.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve been noticin’ somepin,” returned Mrs. Queeder.
“He hain’t the same ez he wuz a little while back. Some
new notion he’s got into his mind, I reckon, somepin he wants
tuh do an’ kain’t, er somepin new in ’ligion, mebbe. Yuh
kain’t ever tell whut’s botherin’ him.”</p>

<p>Jane “’lowed” as much and the conversation ended.
But still Queeder brooded, trying to solve the knotty problem,
which depended, of course, on the open or secret sale of
the land—secret, if possible, he now finally decided, seeing
that his family had always been so unkind to him. They
deserved nothing better. It was his—why not?</p>

<p>In due time appeared a prospector, mounted on horseback
and dressed for rough travel, who, looking over the
fields of this area and noting the value of these particular
acres, the surface outcropping of a thick vein, became intensely
interested. Queeder was not to be seen at the time,
having gone to some remote portion of the farm, but Mrs.
Queeder, wholly ignorant of the value of the land and
therefore of the half-suppressed light in the stranger’s eye,
greeted him pleasantly enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Would you let me have a drink of water?” inquired the
stranger when she appeared at the door.</p>

<p>“Sartinly,” she replied with a tone of great respect.
Even comparatively well-dressed strangers were so rare here.</p>

<p>Old Queeder in a distant field observing him at the well,
now started for the house.</p>

<p>“What is that stuff you make your fences out of?” asked
the stranger agreeably, wondering if they knew.</p>

<p>“Well, now, I dunno,” said Mrs. Queeder. “It’s some
kind o’ stone, I reckon—slug lumps, we uns always call hit
aroun’ hyur.”</p>

<p>The newcomer suppressed a desire to smile and stooped to
pick up a piece of the zinc with which the ground was
scattered. It was the same as he had seen some miles back,
only purer and present in much greater quantities. Never
had he seen more and better zinc near the surface. It was
lying everywhere exposed, cultivation, frosts and rains having
denuded it, whereas in the next county other men were
digging for it. The sight of these dilapidated holdings, the
miserable clothing, old Queeder toiling out in the hot fields,
and all this land valueless for agriculture because of its
wondrous mineral wealth, was almost too much for
him.</p>

<p>“Do you own all this land about here?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“’Bout seventy acres,” returned Mrs. Queeder.</p>

<p>“Do you know what it sells at an acre?”</p>

<p>“No. It ain’t wuth much, though, I reckon. I ain’t
heerd o’ none bein’ sold aroun’ hyur fer some time now.”</p>

<p>The prospector involuntarily twitched at the words “not
wuth much.” What would some of his friends and rivals
say if they knew of this particular spot? What if some one
should tell these people? If he could buy it now for a song,
as he well might! Already other prospectors were in the
neighborhood. Had he not eaten at the same table at
Arno with three whom he suspected as such? He must get
this, and get it now.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll stroll over and talk to your husband a moment,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
he remarked and ambled off, the while Mrs.
Queeder and Jane, the twain in loose blue gingham bags of
dresses much blown by the wind, stood in the tumbledown
doorway and looked after him.</p>

<p>“Funny, ain’t he?” said the daughter. “Wonder whut
he wants o’ Paw?”</p>

<p>Old Queeder looked up quizzically from his ploughing,
to which he had returned, as he saw the stranger approaching,
and now surveyed him doubtfully as he offered a cheery
“Good morning.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know if there is any really good farming
land around here for sale?” inquired the prospector
after a few delaying comments about the weather.</p>

<p>“Air yuh wantin’ it fer farmin’?” replied Queeder
cynically and casting a searching look upon the newcomer,
who saw at once by Queeder’s eye that he knew
more than his wife. “They’re buyin’ hit now mostly fer
the min’l ez is onto it, ez I hyur.” At the same time
he perked like a bird to see how this thrust had been
received.</p>

<p>The prospector smiled archly if wisely. “I see,” he said.
“You think it’s good for mining, do you? What would
you hold your land at as mineral land then if you had a
chance to sell it?”</p>

<p>Queeder thought for a while. Two wood doves cooed
mournfully in the distance and a blackbird squeaked rustily
before he answered.</p>

<p>“I dunno ez I keer tuh sell yit.” He had been getting
notions of late as to what might be done if he were to retain
his land, bid it up against the desires of one and
another, only also the thought of how his wife and children
might soon learn and insist on dividing the profits with
him if he did sell it was haunting him. Those dreams of
getting out in the world and seeing something, of getting
away from his family and being happy in some weird, free
way, were actually torturing him.</p>

<p>“Who owns the land just below here, then?” asked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
stranger, realizing that his idea of buying for little or nothing
might as well be abandoned. But at this Queeder winced.
For after all, the land adjoining had considerable mineral
on it also, as he well knew.</p>

<p>“Why, let me see,” he replied waspishly, with mingled
feelings of opposition and indifference. “Marradew,” he
finally added, grudgingly. It was no doubt true that this
stranger or some other could buy of other farmers if he refused
to sell. Still, land around here anywhere must be
worth something, his as much as any other. If Dunk Porter
had received $3,000—</p>

<p>“If you don’t want to sell, I suppose he might,” the
prospector continued pleasantly. The idea was expressed
softly, meditatively, indifferently almost.</p>

<p>There was a silence, in which Queeder calmly leaned on
his plough handles thinking. The possibility of losing this
long-awaited opportunity was dreadful. But he was not
floored yet, for all his hunger and greed. Arnold had said
that the metal alone, these rocks, was worth two cents a
pound, and he could not get it out of his mind that somehow
the land itself, the space of soil aside from the metal,
must be worth something. How could it be otherwise?
Small crops of sorts grew on it.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” he replied defiantly, if internally weakly.
“Yuh might ast. I ain’t heerd o’ his wantin’ to sell.” He
was determined to risk this last if he had to run after
the stranger afterward and beg him to compromise, although
he hoped not to have to do that, either. There were other
prospectors.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet whether I want this,” continued the
prospector heavily and with an air of profound indifference,
“but I’d like to have an option on it, if you’d like to sell.
What’ll you take for an option at sixty days on the entire
seventy acres?”</p>

<p>The worn farmer did not in the least understand what
was meant by the word option, but he was determined not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
to admit it. “Whut’ll yuh give?” he asked finally, in great
doubt as to what to say.</p>

<p>“Well, how about $200 down and $5,000 more at the
end of sixty days if we come to terms at the end of that
time?” He was offering the very lowest figure that he
imagined Queeder would take, if any, for he had heard of
other sales in this vicinity this very day.</p>

<p>Queeder, not knowing what an option was, knew not what
to say. Five thousand was what he had originally supposed
he might be offered, but sixty days! What did he mean by
that? Why not at once if he wanted the place—cash—as
Dunk Porter, according to Arnold, had received? He eyed
the stranger feverishly, fidgeted with his plough handles, and
finally observed almost aimlessly: “I ’low ez I could git seven
thousan’ any day ef I wanted to wait. The feller hyur b’low
me a ways got three thousan’, an’ he’s got thirty acres less’n I
got. Thar’s been a feller aroun’ hyur offerin’ me six thousan’.”</p>

<p>“Well, I might give you $6,000, providing I found the
ground all right,” he said.</p>

<p>“Cash down?” asked Queeder amazedly, kicking at a clod.</p>

<p>“Within sixty days,” answered the prospector.</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Queeder, gloomily. “I thort yuh wanted tuh
buy t’day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the other. “I said an option. If we come
to terms I’ll be back here with the money within sixty days
or before, and we’ll close the thing up—six thousand in cash,
minus the option money. Of course I don’t bind myself
absolutely to buy—just get the privilege of buying at any
time within sixty days, and if I don’t come back within that
time the money I turn over to you to-day is yours, see, and
you’re free to sell the land to some one else.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Queeder. He had dreamed of getting
the money at once and making off all by himself, but here
was this talk of sixty days, which might mean something or
nothing.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the prospector, noting Queeder’s dissatisfaction
and deciding that he must do something to make the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
deal seem more attractive, “suppose we say seven thousand,
then, and I put down $500 cash into your hands now?
How’s that? Seven thousand in sixty days and five hundred
in cash right now. What do you say?”</p>

<p>He reached in his pocket and extracted a wallet thick with
bills, which excited Queeder greatly. Never had so
much ready money, which he might quickly count as his if
he chose, been so near him. After all, $500 in cash was
an amazing amount in itself. With that alone what could
he not do? And then the remainder of the seven thousand
within sixty days! Only, there were his wife and two
children to consider. If he was to carry out his dream of
decamping there must be great secrecy. If they learned of
this—his possession of even so much as five hundred in cash—what
might not happen? Would not Dode or his wife
or Jane, or all three, take it away from him—steal it while
he was asleep? It might well be so. He was so silent and
puzzled that the stranger felt that he was going to reject
his offer.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” he said, as though he were
making a grand concession. “I’ll make it eight thousand
and put up eight hundred. How’s that? If we can’t arrange
it on that basis we’ll have to drop the matter, for I
can’t offer to pay any more,” and at that he returned the
wallet to his pocket.</p>

<p>But Queeder still gazed, made all but dumb by his good
fortune and the difficulties it presented. Eight thousand!
Eight hundred in cash down! He could scarcely understand.</p>

<p>“T’day?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, to-day—only you’ll have to come with me to Arno.
I want to look into your title. Maybe you have a deed,
though—have you?”</p>

<p>Queeder nodded.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s all right I’ll pay you the money at once. I
have a form of agreement here and we can get some one to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
witness it, I suppose. Only we’ll have to get your wife to
sign, too.”</p>

<p>Queeder’s face fell. Here was the rub—his wife and
two children! “She’s gotta sign, hez she?” he inquired
grimly, sadly even. He was beside himself with despair,
disgust. To work and slave so all these years! Then, when
a chance came, to have it all come to nothing, or nearly so!</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the prospector, who saw by his manner and
tone that his wife’s knowledge of it was not desired. “We’ll
have to get her signature, too. I’m sorry if it annoys you,
but the law compels it. Perhaps you could arrange all that
between you in some way. Why not go over and talk to
her about it?”</p>

<p>Queeder hesitated. How he hated it—this sharing with
his wife and son! He didn’t mind Jane so much. But now
if they heard of it they would quarrel with him and want
the larger share. He would have to fight—stand by his
“rights.” And once he had the money—if he ever got it—he
would have to watch it, hide it, to keep it away from
them.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked the prospector, noting his
perturbation. “Does she object to your selling?”</p>

<p>“’Tain’t that. She’ll sell, well enough, once she hyurs.
I didn’t ’low ez I’d let ’er know at fust. She’ll be wantin’
the most uv it—her an’ Dode—an’ hit ain’t ther’n, hit’s
mine. I wuz on hyur fust. I owned this hyur place fust,
’fore ever I saw ’er. She don’t do nuthin’ but fuss an’
fight, ez ’tis.”</p>

<p>“Supposing we go over to the house and talk to her. She
may not be unreasonable. She’s only entitled to a third, you
know, if you don’t want to give her more than that. That’s
the law. That would leave you nearly five thousand. In
fact, if you want it, I’ll see that you get five thousand whatever
she gets.” He had somehow gathered the impression
that five thousand, for himself, meant a great deal to
Queeder.</p>

<p>And true enough, at that the old farmer brightened a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
little. For five thousand? Was not that really more than
he had expected to get for the place as a whole but an hour
before! And supposing his wife did get three thousand?
What of it? Was not his own dream coming true? He
agreed at once and decided to accompany the prospector to
the house. But on the way the farmer paused and gazed
about him. He was as one who scarcely knew what he was
doing. All this money—this new order of things—if it
went through! He felt strange, different, confused. The
mental ills of his many years plus this great fortune with
its complications and possibilities were almost too much for
him. The stranger noted a queer metallic and vacant light
in the old farmer’s eyes as he now turned slowly about from
west to east, staring.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked, a suspicion of insanity
coming to him.</p>

<p>The old man seemed suddenly to come to. “’Tain’t
nuthin’,” he said. “I wuz just thinkin’.”</p>

<p>The prospector meditated on the validity of a contract
made with a lunatic, but the land was too valuable to bother
about trifles. Once a contract was made, even with a half-wit,
the legal difficulties which could be made over any
attempt to break the agreement would be very great.</p>

<p>In the old cabin Jane and her mother wondered at the
meaning of the approaching couple, but old Queeder shooed
off the former as he would have a chicken. Once inside the
single room, which served as parlor, sitting-room, bedroom
and all else convenient, Queeder nervously closed the door
leading into the kitchen, where Jane had retired.</p>

<p>“Go on away, now,” he mumbled, as he saw her there
hanging about. “We want a word with yer Maw, I tell
yuh.”</p>

<p>Lank Jane retired, but later clapped a misshapen ear to
the door until she was driven away by her suspicious father.
Then the farmer began to explain to his wife what it was
all about.</p>

<p>“This hyur stranger—I don’t know your name yit—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span></p>

<p>“Crawford! Crawford!” put in the prospector.</p>

<p>“Crawford—Mr. Crawford—is hyur tuh buy the place
ef he kin. I thought, seein’ ez how yuh’ve got a little int’est
in it—third”—he was careful to add—“we’d better come an’
talk tuh yuh.”</p>

<p>“Int’est!” snapped Mrs. Queeder, sharply and suspiciously,
no thought of the presence of the stranger troubling
her in her expression of her opinion, “I should think I had—workin’
an’ slavin’ on it fer twenty-four year! Well,
whut wuz yuh thinkin’ uv payin’ fer the place?” she asked
of the stranger sharply.</p>

<p>A nervous sign from Queeder, whose acquisitiveness was
so intense that it was almost audible, indicated that he was
not to say.</p>

<p>“Well, now what do you think it would be worth?”</p>

<p>“Dunno ez I kin say exackly,” replied the wife slyly and
greedily, imagining that Queeder, because of his age and
various mental deficiencies was perhaps leaving these negotiations
to her. “Thar’s ben furms aroun’ hyur ez big’s this
sold fer nigh onto two thousan’ dollars.” She was quoting
the topmost figure of which she had ever heard.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s pretty steep, isn’t it?” asked Crawford
solemnly but refusing to look at Queeder. “Ordinarily land
around here is not worth much more than twenty dollars an
acre and you have only seventy, as I understand.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but this hyur land ain’t so pore ez some, nuther,”
rejoined Mrs. Queeder, forgetting her original comment on
it and making the best argument she could for it. “Thar’s
a spring on this hyur one, just b’low the house hyur.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Crawford, “I saw it as I came in. It has
some value. So you think two thousand is what it’s worth,
do you?” He looked at Queeder wisely, as much as to say,
“This is a good joke, Queeder.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Queeder, fairly satisfied that hers was to be the
dominant mind in this argument, now turned to her husband
for counsel. “What do yuh think, Bursay?” she asked.</p>

<p>Queeder, shaken by his duplicity, his fear of discovery, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
greed and troublesome dreams, gazed at her nervously. “I
sartinly think hit’s wuth that much anyhow.”</p>

<p>Crawford now began to explain that he only wanted an
option on it at present, an agreement to sell within a given
time, and if this were given, a paper signed, he would pay
a few dollars to bind the bargain—and at this he looked
wisely at Queeder and half closed one eye, by which the
latter understood that he was to receive the sum originally
agreed upon.</p>

<p>“If you say so we’ll close this right now,” he said ingratiatingly,
taking from his pockets a form of agreement and
opening it. “I’ll just fill this in and you two can sign it.”
He went to the worn poplar table and spread out his paper,
the while Queeder and his wife eyed the proceeding with intense
interest. Neither could read or write but the farmer,
not knowing how he was to get his eight hundred, could
only trust to the ingenuity of the prospector to solve the
problem. Besides, both were hypnotized by the idea of
selling this worthless old land so quickly and for so much,
coming into possession of actual money, and moved and
thought like people in a dream. Mrs. Queeder’s eyelids
had narrowed to thin, greedy lines.</p>

<p>“How much did yuh cal’late yuh’d give tuh bind this
hyur?” she inquired tensely and with a feverish gleam in
her eye.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said the stranger, who was once more looking at
Queeder with an explanatory light in his eye, “about a
hundred dollars, I should say. Wouldn’t that be enough?”</p>

<p>A hundred dollars! Even that sum in this lean world
was a fortune. To Mrs. Queeder, who knew nothing of
the value of the mineral on the farm, it was unbelievable,
an unexplainable windfall, an augury of better things. And
besides, the two thousand to come later! But now came the
question of a witness and how the paper was to be signed.
The prospector, having filled in (in pencil) a sample acknowledgment
of the amount paid—$100—and then having
said, “Now you sign here, Mr. Queeder,” the latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
replied, “But I kain’t write an’ nuther kin my wife.”</p>

<p>“Thar wuzn’t much chance fer schoolin’ around’ hyur
when I wuz young,” simpered his better half.</p>

<p>“Well then, we’ll just have to let you make your marks,
and get some one to witness them. Can your son or daughter
write?”</p>

<p>Here was a new situation and one most unpleasant to both,
for Dode, once called, would wish to rule, being so headstrong
and contrary. He could write his name anyhow, read
a little bit also—but did they want him to know yet? Husband
and wife looked at each dubiously and with suspicion.
What now? The difficulty was solved by the rumble of a
wagon on the nearby road.</p>

<p>“Maybe that is some one who could witness for you?”
suggested Crawford.</p>

<p>Queeder looked out. “Yes, I b’lieve he kin write,” he
commented. “Hi, thar, Lester!” he called. “Come in hyur
a minute! We wantcha fer somepin.”</p>

<p>The rumbling ceased and in due time one Lester Botts, a
farmer, not so much better in appearance than Queeder,
arrived at the door. The prospector explained what was
wanted and the agreement was eventually completed, only
Botts, not knowing of the mineral which Queeder’s acres
represented, was anxious to tell the prospector of better land
than this, from an agricultural view, which could be had for
less money, but he did not know how to go about it. Before
she would sign, Mrs. Queeder made it perfectly clear where
she stood in the matter.</p>

<p>“I git my sheer uv this hyur money now, don’t I,” she
demanded, “paid tuh me right hyur?”</p>

<p>Crawford, uncertain as to Queeder’s wishes in this, looked
at him; and he, knowing his wife’s temper and being moved
by greed, exclaimed, “Yuh don’t git nuthin’ ’ceptin’ I die.
Yuh ain’t entitled tuh no sheer unless’n we’re separatin’,
which we hain’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t sign nuthin’,” said Mrs. Queeder truculently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span></p>

<p>“Of course I don’t want to interfere,” commented the
prospector, soothingly, “but I should think you’d rather give
her her share of this—thirty-three dollars,” he eyed Queeder
persuasively—“and then possibly a third of the two thousand—that’s
only six hundred and sixty—rather than stop the
sale now, wouldn’t you? You’ll have to agree to do something
like that. It’s a good bargain. There ought to be
plenty for everybody.”</p>

<p>The farmer hearkened to the subtlety of this. After all,
six hundred and sixty out of eight thousand was not so
much. Rather than risk delay and discovery he pretended to
soften, and finally consented. The marks were made and
their validity attested by Botts, the one hundred in cash being
counted out in two piles, according to Mrs. Queeder’s
wish, and the agreement pocketed. Then the prospector
accompanied by Mr. Botts, was off—only Queeder, following
and delaying him, was finally handed over in secret the
difference between the hundred and the sum originally
agreed upon. When he saw all the money the old farmer’s
eyes wiggled as if magnetically operated. Trembling with the
agony of greed he waited, and then his hard and knotted fingers
closed upon the bills like the claws of a gripping hawk.</p>

<p>“Thank yuh,” he said aloud. “Thank yuh,” and he
jerked doorward in distress. “See me alone fust when yuh
come ag’in. We gotta be mighty keerful er she’ll find out,
an’ ef she does she’ll not sign nuthin’, an’ raise ol’ Harry,
too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” replied the prospector archly. He
was thinking how easy it would be, in view of all the dishonesty
and chicanery already practised, to insist that the
two thousand written in in pencil was the actual sale price
and efface old Queeder by threatening to expose his duplicity.
However, there were sixty days yet in which to consider this.
“In sixty days, maybe less, I’ll show up.” And he slipped
gracefully away, leaving the old earth-scraper to brood
alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>But all was not ended with the payment of this sum, as
any one might have foretold. For Dode and Jane, hearing
after a little while from their mother of the profitable sale
of the land, were intensely moved. Money—any money,
however small in amount—conjured up visions of pleasure
and ease, and who was to get it, after all the toil here on the
part of all? Where was their share in all this? They had
worked, too. They demanded it in repeated ways, but to no
avail. Their mother and father were obdurate, insisting
that they wait until the sale was completed before any
further consideration was given the matter.</p>

<p>While they were thus arguing, however, quarreling over
even so small a sum as $100, as they thought, a new complication
was added by Dode learning, as he soon did, that this
was all mineral land, that farms were being sold in Adair—the
next township—and even here; that it was rumored that
Queeder had already sold his land for $5,000, and that if he
had he had been beaten, for the land was worth much more—$200
an acre even, or $14,000. At once he suspected his
father and mother of some treachery in connection with the
sale—that there had been no option given, but a genuine
sale made, and that Queeder or his mother, or both, were
concealing a vast sum from himself and Jane. An atmosphere
of intense suspicion and evil will was at once introduced.</p>

<p>“They’ve sold the furm fer $5,000 ’stid uv $2,000; that’s
whut they’ve gone an’ done,” insisted Dode one day to Jane
in the presence of his father and mother. “Ev’rybody aroun’
hyur knows now what this hyur land’s wuth, an’ that’s whut
they got, yuh kin bet.”</p>

<p>“Yuh lie!” shrieked Queeder shrilly, who was at once
struck by the fact that if what Dode said was true he had
walked into a financial as well as a moral trap from which
he could not well extricate himself. “I hain’t sold nuthin’,”
he went on angrily. “Lester Botts wuz hyur an’ seed whut
we done. He signed onto it.”</p>

<p>“Ef the land’s wuth more’n $2,000, that feller ’twuz hyur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
didn’ agree tuh pay no more’n that fer it in hyur,” put in
Mrs. Queeder explanatorily, although, so little did she trust
her husband, she was now beginning to wonder if there might
not have been some secret agreement between him and this
stranger. “Ef he had any different talk with yer Paw,” and
here she eyed old Queeder suspiciously, beginning to recall
the prospector’s smooth airs and ways, “he didn’ say nuthin’
’bout it tuh me. I do rec’leck yer Paw’n him talkin’ over by
the fence yander near an hour afore they come in hyur. I
wondered then whut it wuz about.” She was beginning to
worry as to how she was to get more seeing that the price
agreed upon was now, apparently, inconsequential.</p>

<p>And as for Dode, he now eyed his father cynically and suspiciously.
“I cal’late he got somepin more fer it than he’s
tellin’ us about,” he insisted. “They ain’t sellin’ land down
to Arno right now fer no $200 an acre an’ him not knowin’
it—an’ land not ez good ez this, nuther. Ye’re hidin’ the
money whut yuh got fer it, that’s whut!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Queeder, while greatly disturbed as to the possibility
of duplicity on her husband’s part in connection with all this,
still considered it policy to call Heaven to witness that in
her case at least no duplicity was involved. If more had
been offered or paid she knew nothing of it. For his part
Queeder boiled with fear, rage, general opposition to all of
them and their share in this.</p>

<p>“Yuh consarned varmint!” he squealed, addressing Dode
and leaping to his feet and running for a stick of stovewood,
“I’ll show yuh whuther we air er not! Yuh ’low I steal, do
yuh?”</p>

<p>Dode intercepted him, however, and being the stronger,
pushed him off. It was always so easy so to do—much to
Queeder’s rage. He despised his son for his triumphant
strength alone, to say nothing of his dour cynicism in regard
to himself. The argument was ended by the father being
put out of the house and the mother pleading volubly that in
so far as she knew it was all as she said, that in signing the
secret agreement with her husband she had meant no harm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
to her children, but only to protect them and herself.</p>

<p>But now, brooding over the possibility of Queeder’s deception,
she began to lay plans for his discomfiture in any
way that she might—she and Dode and Jane. Queeder
himself raged secretly between fear and hatred of Dode and
what might follow because of his present knowledge. How
was he to prevent Dode from being present at the final transaction,
and if so how would the secret difference be handed
him? Besides, if he took the sum mentioned, how did he
know that he was not now being overreached? Every day
nearly brought new rumors of new sales at better prices than
he had been able to fix. In addition, each day Mrs. Queeder
cackled like an irritable hen over the possible duplicity of her
husband, although that creature in his secretive greed and
queerness was not to be encompassed. He fought shy of the
house the greater part of each day, jerked like a rat at every
sound or passing stranger and denied himself words to speak
or explain, or passed the lie if they pressed him too warmly.
The seven hundred extra he had received was wrapped in
paper and hidden in a crevice back of a post in the barn, a
tin can serving as an outer protection for his newly acquired
wealth. More than once during the day he returned to that
spot, listened and peeked before he ventured to see whether
it was still safe.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was something deadly in the household order
from now on, little short of madness in fact, for now mother
and children schemed for his downfall while all night long
old Queeder wakened, jerking in the blackness and listening
for any sounds which might be about the barn. On more
than one occasion he changed the hiding place, even going so
far as to keep the money on his person for a time. Once he
found an old rusty butcher knife and, putting that in his
shirt bosom, he slept with it and dreamed of trouble.</p>

<p>Into the heart of this walked another prospector one
morning rejoicing, like the first one, at his find. Like all
good business men he was concerned to see the owner only
and demanded that Queeder be called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, Paw!” called Jane from the rickety doorway.
“Thar’s some one hyur wants tuh see yuh!”</p>

<p>Old Queeder looked warily up from his hot field, where
he had been waiting these many days, and beheld the
stranger. He dropped his weed fighting and came forward.
Dode drifted in from somewhere.</p>

<p>“Pretty dry weather we’re having, isn’t it?” remarked the
stranger pleasantly meeting him halfway in his approach.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied vacantly, for he was very, very much
worn these days, mentally and physically. “It’s tol’able dry!
Tol-able dry!” He wiped his leathery brow with his hand.</p>

<p>“You don’t know of any one about here, do you, who has
any land for sale?”</p>

<p>“Ye’re another one uv them min’l prowspecters, I projeck,
eh?” inquired Queeder, now quite openly. There was no
need to attempt to conceal that fact any longer.</p>

<p>The newcomer was taken aback, for he had not expected
so much awareness in this region so soon. “I am,” he said
frankly.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said Queeder.</p>

<p>“Have you ever thought of selling the land here?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“Well, I dunno,” began the farmer shrewdly. “Thar’ve
been fellers like yuh aroun’ hyar afore now lookin’ at the
place. Whut do yuh cal-late it might be wuth tuh yuh?”
He eyed him sharply the while they strolled still further
away from the spot where Dode, Jane and the mother
formed an audience in the doorway.</p>

<p>The prospector ambled about the place examining the
surface lumps, so very plentiful everywhere.</p>

<p>“This looks like fairly good land to me,” he said quietly
after a time. “You haven’t an idea how much you’d want
an acre for it, have you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I hyur they’re gettin’ ez much ez three hundred
down to Arno,” replied Queeder, exaggerating fiercely.
Now that a second purchaser had appeared he was eager to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
learn how much more, if any, than the original offer would
be made.</p>

<p>“Yes—well, that’s a little steep, don’t you think, considering
the distance the metal would have to be hauled to the
railroad? It’ll cost considerable to get it over there.”</p>

<p>“Not enough, I ’low, tuh make it wuth much less’n three
hundred, would it?” observed Queeder, sagely.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about that. Would you take two
hundred an acre for as much as forty acres of it?”</p>

<p>Old Queeder pricked his ears at the sound of bargain.
As near as he could figure, two hundred an acre for forty
acres would bring him as much as he was now to get for the
entire seventy, and he would still have thirty to dispose of.
The definiteness of the proposition thrilled him, boded
something large for his future—eight thousand for forty,
and all he could wring from the first comer had been eight
thousand for seventy!</p>

<p>“Huh!” he said, hanging on the argument with ease and
leisure. “I got an offer uv a option on the hull uv it fer
twelve thousan’ now.”</p>

<p>“What!” said the stranger, surveying him critically.
“Have you signed any papers in the matter?”</p>

<p>Queeder looked at him for the moment as if he suspected
treachery, and then seeing the gathered family surveying
them from the distant doorway he made the newcomer a
cabalistic sign.</p>

<p>“Come over hyur,” he said, leading off to a distant fence.
At the safe distance they halted. “I tell yuh just how ’tis,”
he observed very secretively. “Thar wuz a feller come along
hyur three er four weeks ago an’ at that time I didn’t know
ez how this hyur now wuz min’l, see? An’ he ast me, ’thout
sayin’ nuthin’ ez tuh whut he knowed, whut I’d take for it,
acre fer acre. Well, thar wuz anuther feller, a neighbor o’
mine, had been along hyur an’ he wuz sayin’ ez how a piece
o’ land just below, about forty acres, wuz sold fer five thousan’
dollars. Seein’ ez how my land wuz the same kind o’
land, only better, I ’lowed ez how thar bein’ seventy acres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
hyur tuh his forty I oughta git nearly twicet ez much, an’
I said so. He didn’t ’low ez I ought at fust, but later on he
kind o’ come roun’ an’ we agreed ez how I bein’ the one that
fust had the place—I wuz farmin’ hyur ’fore ever I married
my wife—that ef any sale wuz made I orter git the biggest
sheer. So we kind o’ fixed it up b’tween us, quiet-like an’
not lettin’ anybody else know, that when it come tuh makin’
out the papers an’ sich at the end uv the sixty days he was to
gimme a shade the best o’ the money afore we signed any
papers. Course I wouldn’t do nuthin’ like that ef the place
hadn’t b’longed tuh me in the fust place, an’ ef me an’ my
wife an’ chil’n got along ez well’s we did at fust, but she’s
allers a-fightin’ an’ squallin’. Ef he come back hyur, ez he
’lowed he would, I wuz t’ have eight thousan’ fer myself,
an’ me an’ my wife wuzta divide the rest b’tween us ez best
we could, her to have her third, ez the law is.”</p>

<p>The stranger listened with mingled astonishment, amusement
and satisfaction at the thought that the contract, if
not exactly illegal, could at least to Queeder be made to appear
so. For an appeal to the wife must break it, and besides
because of the old man’s cupidity he might easily be made to
annul the original agreement. For plainly even now this
farmer did not know the full value of all that he had so
foolishly bartered away. About him were fields literally
solid with zinc under the surface. Commercially $60,000
would be a mere bagatelle to give for it, when the East was
considered. One million dollars would be a ridiculously low
capitalization for a mine based on this property. A hundred
thousand might well be his share for his part in the transaction.
Good heavens, the other fellow had bought a fortune
for a song! It was only fair to try to get it away from him.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how this is, Mr. Queeder,” he said after a
time. “It looks to me as though this fellow, whoever he is,
has given you a little the worst end of this bargain. Your
land is worth much more than that, that’s plain enough. But
you can get out of that easily enough on the ground that you
really didn’t know what you were selling at the time you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
made this bargain. That’s the law, I believe. You don’t
have to stick by an agreement if it’s made when you don’t
understand what you’re doing. As a matter of fact, I think
I could get you out of it if you wanted me to. All you
would have to do would be to refuse to sign any other papers
when the time comes and return the money that’s been paid
you. Then when the time came I would be glad to take over
your whole farm at three hundred dollars an acre and pay
cash down. That would make you a rich man. I’d give you
three thousand cash in hand the day you signed an agreement
to sell. The trouble is you were just taken in. You and
your wife really didn’t know what you were doing.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” squeaked Queeder, “we wuz. We didn’t
’low ez they wuz any min’l on this when we signed that air
contrack.”</p>

<p>Three hundred dollars an acre, as he dumbly figured it
out, meant $21,000—twenty-one instead of a wretched eight
thousand! For the moment he stood there quite lost as to
what to do, say, think, a wavering, element-worn figure.
His bent and shriveled body, raked and gutted by misfortune,
fairly quivered with the knowledge that riches were really
his for the asking, yet also that now, owing to his early error
and ignorance in regard to all this, he might not be able to
arrange for their reception. His seared and tangled brain,
half twisted by solitude, balanced unevenly with the weight
of this marvelous possibility. It crossed the wires of his
mind and made him see strabismically.</p>

<p>The prospector, uncertain as to what his silence indicated,
added: “I might even do a little better than that,
Mr. Queeder—say, twenty-five thousand. You could have
a house in the city for that. Your wife could wear silk
dresses; you yourself need never do another stroke of work;
your son and daughter could go to college if they wanted
to. All you have to do is to refuse to sign that deed when
he comes back—hand him the money or get his address and
let me send it to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span></p>

<p>“He swindled me, so he did!” Queeder almost shouted
now, great beads of sweat standing out upon his brow.
“He tried tuh rob me! He shan’t have an acre, by God—not
an acre!”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said the newcomer, and before he left he
again insinuated into the farmer’s mind the tremendous and
unfair disproportion between twelve (as he understood
Queeder was receiving) and twenty-five thousand. He pictured
the difference in terms of city or town opportunities,
the ease of his future life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the farmer possessed no avenue by which
to escape from his recent duplicity. Having deceived his
wife and children over so comparatively small a sum as
eight thousand, this immensely greater sum offered many
more difficulties—bickering, quarreling, open fighting, perhaps,
so fierce were Dode and his wife in their moods, before
it could be attained. And was he equal to it? At the
same time, although he had never had anything, he was
now feeling as though he had lost a great deal, as if some
one were endeavoring to take something immense away from
him, something which he had always had!</p>

<p>During the days that followed he brooded over this,
avoiding his family as much as possible, while they, wondering
when the first prospector would return and what conversation
or arrangement Queeder had had with the second,
watched him closely. At last he was all but unbalanced
mentally, and by degrees his mind came to possess but one
idea, and that was that his wife, his children, the world, all
were trying to rob him, and that his one escape lay in flight
with his treasure if only he could once gain possession of it.
But how? How? One thing was sure. They should not
have it. He would fight first; he would die. And alone in
his silent field, with ragged body and mind, he brooded
over riches and felt as if he already had them to defend.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the first prospector had been meditating
as to the ease, under the circumstances, with which Queeder’s
land could be taken from him at the very nominal price<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
of two thousand, considering the secrecy which, according to
Queeder’s own wish, must attach to the transfer of all
moneys over that sum. Once the deed was signed—the same
reading for two thousand—in the presence of the wife and a
lawyer who should accompany him, how easy to walk off and
pay no more, standing calmly on the letter of the contract!</p>

<p>It was nearing that last day now and the terrible suspense
was telling. Queeder was in no mental state to endure
anything. His hollow eyes showed the wondering out of
which nothing had come. His nervous strolling here and
there had lost all semblance of reason. Then on the last of
the sixty allotted days there rode forward the now bane of
his existence, the original prospector, accompanied by Attorney
Giles, of Arno, a veritable scamp and rascal of a lawyer.</p>

<p>At first on seeing them Queeder felt a strong impulse to
run away, but on second consideration he feared so to do.
The land was his. If he did not stay Dode and Mrs.
Queeder might enter on some arrangement without his consent—something
which would leave him landless, money-less—or
they might find out something about the extra
money he had taken and contracted for, the better price he
was now privately to receive. It was essential that he stay,
and yet he had no least idea as to how he would solve it all.</p>

<p>Jane, who was in the doorway as they entered the yard,
was the one to welcome them, although Dode, watchful
and working in a nearby patch, saluted them next. Then
Mrs. Queeder examined them cynically and with much
opposition. These, then, were the twain who were expecting
to misuse her financially!</p>

<p>“Where’s your father, Dode?” asked Attorney Giles
familiarly, for he knew them well.</p>

<p>“Over thar in the second ’tater patch,” answered Dode
sourly. A moment later he added with rough calculation,
“Ef ye’re comin’ about the land, though, I ’low ez ’twon’t
do yuh no good. Maw an’ Paw have decided not tuh sell.
The place is wuth a heap more’n whut you all’re offerin’.
They’re sellin’ land roun’ Arno with not near ez much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
min’l onto hit ez this hez for three hundred now, an’ yuh
all only wanta give two thousan’ fer the hull place, I hyur.
Maw’n Paw’d be fools ef they’d agree tuh that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come now,” exclaimed Giles placatively and yet
irritably—a very wasp who was always attempting to
smooth over the ruffled tempers of people on just such
trying occasions as this. “Mr. Crawford here has an option
on this property signed by your mother and father and witnessed
by a Mr.”—he considered the slip—“a Mr. Botts—oh,
yes, Lester Botts. You cannot legally escape that.
All Mr. Crawford has to do is to offer you the money—leave
it here, in fact—and the property is his. That is the
law. An option is an option, and this one has a witness.
I don’t see how you can hope to escape it, really.”</p>

<p>“They wuzn’t nuthin’ said about no min’l when I signed
that air,” insisted Mrs. Queeder, “an’ I don’t ’low ez no
paper whut I didn’t know the meanin’ uv is goin’ tuh be
good anywhar. Leastways, I won’t put my name onto
nuthin’ else.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” said Mr. Giles fussily, “We’d better get
Mr. Queeder in here and see what he says to this. I’m
sure he’ll not take any such unreasonable and illegal view.”</p>

<p>In the meantime old Queeder, called for lustily by Jane,
came edging around the house corner like some hunted
animal—dark, fearful, suspicious—and at sight of him the
prospector and lawyer, who had seated themselves, arose.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, Mr. Queeder,” said the prospector,
but stopped, astonished at the weird manner in which
Queeder passed an aimless hand over his brow and gazed
almost dully before him. He had more the appearance of
a hungry bird than a human being. He was yellow, emaciated,
all but wild.</p>

<p>“Look at Paw!” whispered Jane to Dode, used as she
was to all the old man’s idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Queeder,” began the lawyer, undisturbed by
the whisper of Jane and anxious to smooth over a very
troublesome situation, “here we are. We have come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
settle this sale with you according to the terms of the option.
I suppose you’re ready?”</p>

<p>“Whut?” asked old Queeder aimlessly, then, recovering
himself slightly, began, “I hain’t goin’ tuh sign nuthin’!
Nuthin’ ’tall! That’s whut I hain’t! Nuthin’!” He
opened and closed his fingers and twisted and craned his
neck as though physically there were something very much
awry with him.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” queried the lawyer incisively, attempting
by his tone to overawe him or bring him to his senses, “not
sign? What do you mean by saying you won’t sign? You
gave an option here for the sum of $100 cash in hand,
signed by you and your wife and witnessed by Lester Botts,
and now you say you won’t sign! I don’t want to be harsh,
but there’s a definite contract entered into here and money
passed, and such things can’t be handled in any such light
way, Mr. Queeder. This is a contract, a very serious
matter before the law, Mr. Queeder, a very serious matter.
The law provides a very definite remedy in a case of this
kind. Whether you want to sign or not, with this option
we have here and what it calls for we can pay over the
money before witnesses and enter suit for possession and win
it.”</p>

<p>“Not when a feller’s never knowed whut he wuz doin’
when he signed,” insisted Dode, who by now, because of his
self-interest and the appearance of his father having been
misled, was coming round to a more sympathetic or at least
friendly attitude.</p>

<p>“I’ll not sign nuthin’,” insisted Queeder grimly. “I
hain’t a-goin’ tuh be swindled out o’ my prupetty. I never
knowed they wuz min’l onto hit, like they is—leastways not
whut it wuz wuth—an’ I won’t sign, an’ yuh ain’t a-goin’
tuh make me. Ye’re a-tryin’ tuh get it away from me fur
nuthin’, that’s whut ye’re a-tryin’ tuh do. I won’t sign
nuthin’!”</p>

<p>“I had no idee they wuz min’l onto hit when I signed,”
whimpered Mrs. Queeder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, come, come!” put in Crawford sternly, deciding to
deal with this eccentric character and believing that he could
overawe him by referring to the secret agreement between
them, “don’t forget, Mr. Queeder, that I had a special
agreement with you concerning all this.” He was not quite
sure now as to what he would have to pay—the two or the
eight. “Are you going to keep your bargain with me or
not? You want to decide quick now. Which is it?”</p>

<p>“Git out!” shouted Queeder, becoming wildly excited
and waving his hands and jumping backward. “Yuh
swindled me, that’s whutcha done! Yut thort yuh’d git
this place fer nothin’. Well, yuh won’t—yuh kain’t. I
won’t sign nuthin’. I won’t sign nuthin’.” His eyes were
red and wild from too much brooding.</p>

<p>Now it was that Crawford, who had been hoping to get
it all for two thousand, decided to stick to his private agreement
to pay eight, only instead of waiting to adjust it with
Queeder in private he decided now to use it openly in an
attempt to suborn the family to his point of view by showing
them how much he really was to have and how unjust
Queeder had planned to be to himself and them. In all
certainty the family understood it as only two. If he would
now let them know how matters stood, perhaps that would
make a difference in his favor.</p>

<p>“You call eight thousand for this place swindling, and
after you’ve taken eight hundred dollars of my money and
kept it for sixty days?”</p>

<p>“Whut’s that?” asked Dode, edging nearer, then turning
and glaring at his father and eyeing his mother amazedly.
This surpassed in amount and importance anything he had
imagined had been secured by them, and of course he assumed
that both were lying. “Eight thousan’! I thort
yuh said it wuz two!” He looked at his mother for confirmation.</p>

<p>The latter was a picture of genuine surprise. “That’s
the fust I hearn uv any eight thousan’,” she replied dumbly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
her own veracity in regard to the transaction being in
question.</p>

<p>The picture that Queeder made under the circumstances
was remarkable. Quite upset by this half-unexpected and
yet feared revelation, he was now quite beside himself with
rage, fear, the insolvability of the amazing tangle into which
he had worked himself. The idea that after he had made
an agreement with this man, which was really unfair to
himself, he should turn on him in this way was all but
mentally upsetting. Besides, the fact that his wife and son
now knew how greedy and selfish he had been weakened
him to the point of terror.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I offered him, just the same,” went on
Crawford aggressively and noting the extreme effect, “and
that’s what he agreed to take, and that’s what I’m here to
pay. I paid him $800 in cash to bind the bargain, and he
has the money now somewhere. His saying now that I tried
to swindle him is too funny! He asked me not to say anything
about it because the land was all his and he wanted
to adjust things with you three in his own way.”</p>

<p>“Git outen hyur!” shouted Queeder savagely, going all
but mad, “before I kill yuh! I hain’t signed nuthin’! We
never said nuthin’ about no $8,000. It wuz $2,000—that’s
what it wuz! Ye’re trin’ tuh swindle me, the hull varmint
passel o’ yuh! I won’t sign nuthin’!” and he stooped and
attempted to seize a stool that stood near the wall.</p>

<p>At this all retreated except Dode, who, having mastered
his father in more than one preceding contest, now descended
on him and with one push of his arm knocked him
down, so weak was he, while the lawyer and prospector,
seeing him prone, attempted to interfere in his behalf. What
Dode was really thinking was that now was his chance.
His father had lied to him. He was naturally afraid of
him. Why not force him by sheer brute strength to accept
this agreement and take the money? Once it was paid here
before him, if he could make his father sign, he could take
his share without let or hindrance. Of what dreams might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
not this be the fulfilment? “He agreed on’t, an’ now he’s
gotta do it,” he thought; “that’s all.”</p>

<p>“No fighting, now,” called Giles. “We don’t want any
fighting—just to settle this thing pleasantly, that’s all.”</p>

<p>After all, Queeder’s second signature or <em>mark</em> would be
required, peaceably if possible, and besides they wished no
physical violence. They were men of business, not of war.</p>

<p>“Yuh say he agreed tuh take $8,000, did he?” queried
Dode, the actuality of so huge a sum ready to be paid in
cash seeming to him almost unbelievable.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” replied the prospector.</p>

<p>“Then, by heck, he’s gotta make good on whut he said!”
said Dode with a roll of his round head, his arms akimbo,
heavily anxious to see the money paid over. “Here you,”
he now turned to his father and began—for his prostrate
father, having fallen and injured his head, was still lying
semi-propped on his elbows, surveying the group with almost
non-comprehending eyes, too confused and lunatic to quite
realize what was going on or to offer any real resistance.
“Whut’s a-gittin’ into yuh, anyhow, Ol’ Spindle Shanks?
Git up hyur!” Dode went over and lifted his father to his
feet and pushed him toward a chair at the table. “Yuh
might ez well sign fer this, now ’at yuh’ve begun it. Whar’s
the paper?” he asked of the lawyer. “Yuh just show him
whar he orter sign, an’ I guess he’ll do it. But let’s see this
hyur money that ye’re a-goin’ tuh pay over fust,” he added,
“afore he signs. I wanta see ef it’s orl right.”</p>

<p>The prospector extracted the actual cash from a wallet,
having previously calculated that a check would never be
accepted, and the lawyer presented the deed to be signed. At
the same time Dode took the money and began to count it.</p>

<p>“All he has to do,” observed Giles to the others as he did
so, “is to sign this second paper, he and his wife. If you
can read,” he said to Dode when the latter had concluded,
and seeing how satisfactorily things were going, “you can
see for yourself what it is.” Dode now turned and picked
it up and looked at it as though it were as simple and clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
as daylight. “As you can see,” went on the lawyer, “we
agreed to buy this land of him for eight thousand dollars.
We have already paid him eight hundred. That leaves
seven thousand two hundred still to pay, which you have
there,” and he touched the money in Dode’s hands. The
latter was so moved by the reality of the cash that he could
scarcely speak for joy. Think of it—seven thousand two
hundred dollars—and all for this wretched bony land!</p>

<p>“Well, did yuh ever!” exclaimed Mrs. Queeder and Jane
in chorus. “Who’d ’a’ thort! Eight thousan’!”</p>

<p>Old Queeder, still stunned and befogged mentally, was
yet recovering himself sufficiently to rise from the chair and
look strangely about, now that Dode was attempting to
make him sign, but his loving son uncompromisingly pushed
him back again.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Ol’ Spindle Shanks,” he repeated roughly.
“Just yuh stay whar yuh air an’ sign as he asts yuh tuh.
Yuh agreed tuh this, an’ yuh might ez well stick tuh it.
Ye’re gittin’ so yuh don’t know what yuh want no more,”
he jested, now that he realized that for some strange reason
he had his father completely under his sway. The latter
was quite helplessly dumb. “Yuh agreed tuh this, he says.
Did ja? Air yuh clean gone?”</p>

<p>“Lawsy!” put in the excited Mrs. Queeder. “Eight
thousan’! An’ him a-walkin’ roun’ hyur all the time sayin’
hit wuz only two an’ never sayin’ nuthin’ else tuh nobody!
Who’d ’a’ thort hit! An’ him a-goin’ tuh git hit all ef he
could an’ say nuthin’!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Jane, gazing at her father greedily and vindictively,
“tryin’ tuh git it all fer hisself! An’ us a-workin’
hyur year in an’ year out on this hyur ol’ place tuh keep
him comfortable!” She was no less hard in her glances than
her brother. Her father seemed little less than a thief, attempting
to rob them of the hard-earned fruit of their toil.</p>

<p>As the lawyer took the paper from Dode and spread it
upon the old board table and handed Queeder a pen the
latter took it aimlessly, quite as a child might have, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
made his mark where indicated, Mr. Giles observing very
cautiously, “This is of your own free will and deed, is it,
Mr. Queeder?” The old man made no reply. For the
time being anyhow, possibly due to the blow on his head as
he fell, he had lost the main current of his idea, which was
not to sign. After signing he looked vaguely around, as
though uncertain as to what else might be requested of him,
while Mrs. Queeder made her mark, answering “yes” to the
same shrewd question. Then Dode, as the senior intelligence
of this institution and the one who by right of force
now dominated, having witnessed the marks of his father
and mother, as did Jane, two signatures being necessary, he
took the money and before the straining eyes of his relatives
proceeded to recount it. Meanwhile old Queeder, still
asleep to the significance of the money, sat quite still, but
clawed at it as though it were something which he ought to
want, but was not quite sure of it.</p>

<p>“You find it all right, I suppose?” asked the lawyer, who
was turning to go. Dode acknowledged that it was quite
correct.</p>

<p>Then the two visitors, possessed of the desired deed, departed.
The family, barring the father, who sat there still
in a daze, began to discuss how the remarkable sum was to
be divided.</p>

<p>“Now, I just wanta tell yuh one thing, Dode,” urged
the mother, all avarice and anxiety for herself, “a third o’
that, whutever ’tis, b’longs tuh me, accordin’ tuh law!”</p>

<p>“An’ I sartinly oughta git a part o’ that thar, workin’
the way I have,” insisted Jane, standing closely over Dode.</p>

<p>“Well, just keep yer hands off till I git through, cantcha?”
asked Dode, beginning for the third time to count it.
The mere feel of it was so entrancing! What doors would
it not open? He could get married now, go to the city, do
a hundred things he had always wanted to do. The fact
that his father was entitled to anything or that, having lost
his wits, he was now completely helpless, a pathetic figure
and very likely from now on doomed to wander about alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
or to do his will, moved him not in the least. By right of
strength and malehood he was now practically master here,
or so he felt himself to be. As he fingered the money he
glowed and talked, thinking wondrous things, then suddenly
remembering the concealed eight hundred, or his
father’s part of it, he added, “Yes, an’ whar’s that other
eight hundred, I’d like tuh know? He’s a-carryin’ it aroun’
with him er hidin’ it hyurabout mebbe!” Then eyeing the
crumpled victim suspiciously, he began to feel in the old
man’s clothes, but, not finding anything, desisted, saying they
might get it later. The money in his hands was finally divided:
a third to Mrs. Queeder, a fourth to Jane, the balance
to himself as the faithful heir and helper of his father,
the while he speculated as to the whereabouts of the remaining
eight hundred.</p>

<p>Just then Queeder, who up to this time had been completely
bereft of his senses, now recovered sufficiently to
guess nearly all of what had so recently transpired. With
a bound he was on his feet, and, looking wildly about him,
exclaiming as he did so in a thin, reedy voice, “They’ve stole
my prupetty! They’ve stole my prupetty! I’ve been
robbed, I have! I’ve been robbed! Eh! Eh! Eh! This
hyur land ain’t wuth only eight thousan’—hit’s wuth
twenty-five thousan’, an’ that’s whut I could ’a’ had for it,
an’ they’ve gone an’ made me sign it all away! Eh! Eh!
Eh!” He jigged and moaned, dancing helplessly about until,
seeing Dode with his share of the money still held safely in
his hand, his maniacal chagrin took a new form, and, seizing
it and running to the open door, he began to throw a portion
of the precious bills to the winds, crying as he did so,
“They’ve stole my prupetty! They’ve stole my prupetty!
I don’t want the consarned money—I don’t want it! I
want my prupetty! Eh! Eh! Eh!”</p>

<p>In this astonishing situation Dode saw but one factor—the
money. Knowing nothing of the second prospector’s
offer, he could not realize what it was that so infuriated the
old man and had finally completely upset his mind. As the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
latter jigged and screamed and threw the money about he
fell upon him with the energy of a wildcat and, having toppled
him over and wrested the remainder of the cash from
him, he held him safely down, the while he called to his
sister and mother, “Pick up the money, cantcha? Pick up
the money an’ git a rope, cantcha? Git a rope! Cantcha
see he’s done gone plum daffy? He’s outen his head, I tell
yuh. He’s crazy, he is, shore! Git a rope!” and eyeing the
money now being assembled by his helpful relatives, he
pressed the struggling maniac’s body to the floor. When
the latter was safely tied and the money returned, the affectionate
son arose and, having once more recounted his
share in order to see that it was all there, he was content
to look about him somewhat more kindly on an all too
treacherous world. Then, seeing the old man where he was
trussed like a fowl for market, he added, somewhat sympathetically,
it may be:</p>

<p>“Well, who’d ’a’ thort! Pore ol’ Pap! I do b’lieve he’s
outen his mind for shore this time! He’s clean gone—plum
daffy.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s whut he is, I do b’lieve,” added Mrs.
Queeder with a modicum of wifely interest, yet more concerned
at that with her part of the money than anything
else.</p>

<p>Then Dode, his mother and sister began most unconcernedly
to speculate as to what if anything was next to
be done with the old farmer, the while the latter rolled a
vacant eye over a scene he was no longer able to interpret.</p>

MARRIAGE—FOR ONE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Whenever</span> I think of love and marriage I think of
Wray. That clerkly figure. That clerkly mind. He
was among the first people I met when I came to New
York and, like so many of the millions seeking to make
their way, he was busy about his affairs. Fortunately, as
I saw it, with the limitations of the average man he had the
ambitions of the average man. At that time he was connected
with one of those large commercial agencies which
inquire into the standing of business men, small and large,
and report their findings, for a price, to other business men.
He was very much interested in his work and seemed satisfied
that should he persist in it he was certain to achieve
what was perhaps a fair enough ambition: a managership in
some branch of this great concern, which same would pay
him so much as five or six thousand a year. The thing about
him that interested me, apart from a genial and pleasing
disposition, was the fact that with all his wealth of opportunity
before him for studying the human mind, its resources
and resourcefulness, its inhibitions and liberations, its humor,
tragedy, and general shiftiness and changefulness,
still he was largely concerned with the bare facts of the
differing enterprises whose character he was supposed to
investigate. Were they solvent? Could and did they pay
their bills? What was their capital stock? How much
cash did they have on hand?... Such was the nature of
the data he needed, and to this he largely confined himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, by turns he was amused or astonished or
made angry or self-righteous by the tricks, the secretiveness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
the errors and the downright meanness of spirit of so many
he had to deal with. As for himself, he had the feeling that
he was honest, straightforward, not as limited or worthless
as some of these others, and it was on this score that he was
convinced he would succeed, as he did eventually, within
his limitations, of course. What interested me and now
makes me look upon him always as an excellent illustration
of the futility of the dream of exact or even suitable
rewards was his clerkly and highly respectable faith in the
same. If a man did as he should do, if he were industrious
and honest and saving and courteous and a few more of
those many things we all know we ought to be, then in that
orderly nature of things which he assumed to hold one must
get along better than some others. What—an honest, industrious,
careful man not do better than one who was none of
these things—a person who flagrantly disregarded them,
say? What nonsense. It must be so. Of course there were
accidents and sickness, and men stole from one another, as
he saw illustrated in his daily round. And banks failed, and
there were trusts and combinations being formed that did
not seem to be entirely in tune with the interests of the
average man. But even so, all things considered, the
average man, if he did as above, was likely to fare much
better than the one who did not. In short, there was such
a thing as approximate justice. Good did prevail, in the
main, and the wicked were punished, as they should be.</p>

<p>And in the matter of love and marriage he held definite
views also. Not that he was unduly narrow or was inclined
to censure those whose lives had not worked out as well as
he hoped his own would, but he thought there was a fine
line of tact somewhere in this matter of marriage which led
to success there quite as the qualities outlined above led,
or should lead, to success in matters more material or practical.
One had to understand something about women.
One had to be sure that when one went a-courting one
selected a woman of sense as well as of charm, one who came
of good stock and hence would be possessed of good taste<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
and good principles. She need not be rich; she might even
be poor. And one had to be reasonably sure that one loved
her. So many that went a-courting imagined they loved and
were loved when it was nothing more than a silly passing
passion. Wray knew. And so many women were designing,
or at least light and flighty; they could not help a serious
man to succeed if they would. However, in many out-of-the-way
corners of the world were the really sensible and
worthy girls, whom it was an honor to marry, and it was
one of these that he was going to choose. Yet even there
it was necessary to exercise care: one might marry a girl
who was too narrow and conventional, one who would not
understand the world and hence be full of prejudices. He
was for the intelligent and practical and liberal girl, if he
could find her, one who was his mental equal.</p>

<p>It was when he had become secretary to a certain somebody
that he encountered in his office a girl who seemed to
him to embody nearly all of the virtues or qualities which he
thought necessary. She was the daughter of very modestly
circumstanced parents who dwelt in the nearby suburb of
O——, and a very capable and faithful stenographer, of
course. If you had seen the small and respectable suburb
from which she emanated you would understand. She was
really pretty and appeared to be practical and sensible in
many ways, but still very much in leash to the instructions
and orders and tenets of her home and her church and her
family circle, three worlds as fixed and definite and worthy
and respectable in her thought as even the most enthusiastic
of those who seek to maintain the order and virtue of the
world would have wished. According to him, as he soon
informed me—since we exchanged nearly all our affairs
whenever we met, she was opposed to the theatre, dancing,
any form of night dining or visiting in the city on weekdays,
as well as anything that in her religious and home
world might be construed as desecration of the Sabbath. I
recall him describing her as narrow “as yet,” but he hoped
to make her more liberal in the course of time. He also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
told me with some amusement and the air of a man of the
world that it was impossible for him to win her to so simple
an outing as rowing on the Sabbath on the little river near
her home because it was wrong; on the contrary, he had to
go to church with her and her parents. Although he belonged
to no church and was mildly interested in socialism,
he kept these facts from her knowledge. The theatre could
not even be mentioned as a form of amusement and she could
not and would not dance; she looked upon his inclination
for the same as not only worldly but loose and sinful. However,
as he told me, he was very fond of her and was doing
his best to influence and enlighten her. She was too fine
and intelligent a girl to stick to such notions. She would
come out of them.</p>

<p>By very slow degrees (he was about his business of courting
her all of two or three years) he succeeded in bringing
her to the place where she did not object to staying downtown
to dinner with him on a weekday, even went with him
to a sacred or musical concert of a Sunday night, but all unbeknown
to her parents or neighbors, of course. But what
he considered his greatest triumph was when he succeeded
in interesting her in books, especially bits of history and
philosophy that he thought very liberal and which no doubt
generated some thin wisps of doubt in her own mind. Also,
because he was intensely fond of the theatre and had always
looked upon it as the chiefest of the sources of his harmless
entertainment, he eventually induced her to attend one performance,
and then another and another. In short, he
emancipated her in so far as he could, and seemed to be
delighted with the result.</p>

<p>With their marriage came a new form of life for both of
them, but more especially for her. They took a small apartment
in New York, a city upon which originally she had
looked with no little suspicion, and they began to pick up
various friends. It was not long before she had joined a
literary club which was being formed in their vicinity, and
here she met a certain type of restless, pushing, seeking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
woman for whom Wray did not care—a Mrs. Drake and a
Mrs. Munshaw, among others, who, from the first, as he
afterward told me, he knew could be of no possible value to
any one. But Bessie liked them and was about with them
here, there, and everywhere.</p>

<p>It was about this time that I had my first suspicion of
anything untoward in their hitherto happy relations. I
did not see him often now, but when I did visit them at their
small apartment, could not help seeing that Mrs. Wray was
proving almost too apt a pupil in the realm in which he had
interested her. It was plain that she had been emancipated
from quite all of her old notions as to the sinfulness of the
stage, and in regard to reading and living in general.
Plainly, Wray had proved the Prince Charming, who had
entered the secret garden and waked the sleeping princess to
a world of things she had never dreamed of. She had
reached the place where she was criticizing certain popular
authors, spoke of a curiously enlightened history of France
she was reading, of certain bits of philosophy and poetry
which her new club were discussing. From the nature of
the conversation being carried on by the three of us I could
see that Wray was beginning to feel that the unsophisticated
young girl he had married a little while before might yet outstrip
him in the very realm in which he had hoped to be her
permanent guide. More than once, as I noticed, she chose
to question or contradict him as to a matter of fact, and I
think he was astonished if not irritated by the fact that she
knew more than he about the import of a certain plot or the
relativity of certain dates in history. And with the force
and determination that had caused her to stand by her
former convictions, she now aired and defended her new
knowledge. Not that her manner was superior or irritating
exactly; she had a friendly way of including and consulting
him in regard to many things which indicated that as yet
she had no thought of manifesting a superiority which she
did not feel. “That’s not right, dearest. His name is
Bentley. He is the author of a play that was here last year—<em>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
Seven Rings of Manfred</em>—don’t you remember?”
And Wray, much against his will, was compelled to confess
that she was right.</p>

<p>Whenever he met me alone after this, however, he would
confide the growing nature of his doubts and perplexities.
Bessie was no more the girl she had been when he first met
her than he was like the boy he had been at ten years of age.
A great, a very great change was coming over her. She was
becoming more aggressive and argumentative and self-centred
all the time, more this, more that. She was reading a
great deal, much too much for the kind of life she was called
upon to lead. Of late they had been having long and unnecessary
arguments that were of no consequence however
they were settled, and yet if they were not settled to suite
her she was angry or irritable. She was neglecting her home
and running about all the time with her new-found friends.
She did not like the same plays he did. He wanted a play
that was light and amusing, whereas she wanted one with
some serious moral or intellectual twist to it. She read only
serious books now and was attending a course of lectures,
whereas he, as he now confessed, was more or less bored by
serious books. What was the good of them? They only
stirred up thoughts and emotions which were better left unstirred.
And she liked music, or was pretending she did,
grand opera, recitals and that sort of thing, whereas he was
not much interested in music. Grand opera bored him, and
he was free to admit it, but if he would not accompany her
she would go with one or both of those two wretched women
he was beginning to detest. Their husbands had a little
money and gave them a free rein in the matter of their social
and artistic aspirations. They had no household duties to
speak of and could come and go as they chose, and Wray now
insisted that it was they who were aiding and abetting Bessie
in these various interests and enthusiasms and stirring her
up to go and do and be. What was he to do? No good
could come if things went on as they were going. They
were having frequent quarrels, and more than once lately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
she had threatened to leave him and do for herself here in
New York, as he well knew she could. He was doing very
well now and they could be happy together if only these
others could be done away with.</p>

<p>It was only a month or two after this that Wray came to
see me, in a very distrait state of mind. After attempting to
discuss several other things quite casually he confessed that
his young wife had left him. She had taken a room somewhere
and had resumed work as a stenographer, and although
he met her occasionally in the subway she would have nothing
to do with him. She wanted to end it all. And would I
believe it? She was accusing him of being narrow and
ignorant and stubborn and a number of other things! Only
think of it! And three or four years ago she had thought he
was all wrong when he wanted to go rowing on Sunday or
stay downtown to dinner of an evening. Could such things
be possible? And yet he loved her, in spite of all the things
that had come up between them. He couldn’t help it. He
couldn’t help thinking how sweet and innocent and strange
she was when he first met her, how she loved her parents
and respected their wishes. And now see. “I wish to God,”
he suddenly exclaimed in the midst of the “oldtime” picture
he was painting of her, “that I hadn’t been so anxious to
change her. She was all right as she was, if I had only
known it. She didn’t know anything about these new-fangled
things then, and I wasn’t satisfied till I got her interested in
them. And now see. She leaves me and says I’m narrow
and stubborn, that I’m trying to hold her back intellectually.
And all because I don’t want to do all the things she wants
to do and am not interested in the things that interest her,
now.”</p>

<p>I shook my head. Of what value was advice in such a
situation as this, especially from one who was satisfied that
the mysteries of temperament of either were not to be unraveled
or adjusted save by nature—the accidents of chance and
affinity, or the deadly opposition which keep apart those
unsuited to each other? Nevertheless, being appealed to for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
advice, I ventured a silly suggestion, borrowed from another.
He had said that if he could but win her back he would be
willing to modify the pointless opposition and contention that
had driven her away. She might go her intellectual way as
she chose if she would only come back. Seeing him so
tractable and so very wishful, I now suggested a thing that
had been done by another in a somewhat related situation.
He was to win her back by offering her such terms as she
would accept, and then, in order to bind her to him, he was
to induce her to have a child. That would capture her
sympathy, very likely, as well as insinuate an image of
himself into her affectionate consideration. Those who had
children rarely separated—or so I said.</p>

<p>The thought appealed to him intensely. It satisfied his
practical and clerkly nature. He left me hopefully and I
saw nothing of him for several months, at the end of which
time he came to report that all was once more well with him.
She had come back, and in order to seal the new pact he had
taken a larger apartment in a more engaging part of the city.
Bessie was going on with her club work, and he was not
opposing her in anything. And then within the year came a
child and there followed all those simple, homey, and seemingly
binding and restraining things which go with the
rearing and protection of a young life.</p>

<p>But even during that period, as I was now to learn, all
was not as smooth as I had hoped. Talking to me in Wray’s
absence once Bessie remarked that, delightful as it was to
have a child of her own, she could see herself as little other
than a milch cow with an attendant calf, bound to its service
until it should be able to look after itself. Another time she
remarked that mothers were bond-servants, that even though
she adored her little girl she could not help seeing what a
chain and a weight a child was to one who had ambitions
beyond those of motherhood. But Wray, clerkly soul that
he was, was all but lost in rapture. There was a small park
nearby, and here he could be found trundling his infant in
a handsome baby-carriage whenever his duties would permit.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
He would sit or walk where were others who had children
of about the age of his own so that he might compare them.
He liked to speculate on the charm and innocence of babyhood
and was amused by a hundred things which he had
never noticed in the children of others. Already he was
beginning to formulate plans for little Janet’s future. It
was hard for children to be cooped up in an apartment house
in the city. In a year or two, if he could win Bessie to the
idea, they would move to some suburban town where Janet
could have the country air.</p>

<p>They were prospering now and could engage a nursemaid,
so Mrs. Wray resumed her intellectual pursuits and her freedom.
Throughout it all one could see that, respect Wray
as she might as a dutiful and affectionate and methodical
man, she could not love or admire him, and that mainly because
of the gap that lay between them intellectually. Dissemble
as he might, there was always the hiatus that lies
between those who think or dream a little and those who
aspire and dream much. Superiority of intellect was not altogether
the point; she was not so much superior as different,
as I saw it. Rather, they were two differing rates of motion,
flowing side by side for the time being only, his the slower,
hers the quicker. And it mattered not that his conformed
more to the conventional thought and emotions of the majority.
Hers was the more satisfactory to herself and constituted
an urge which he feared rather than despised; and his
was more satisfactory to himself, compromise as he would.
Observing them together one could see how proud he was of
her and of his relationship to her, how he felt that he had
captured a prize, regardless of the conditions by which it
was retained; and on the other hand one could easily see how
little she held him in her thought and mood. She was forever
talking to others about those things which she knew did
not interest him or to which he was opposed.</p>

<p>For surcease she plunged into those old activities that had
so troubled him at first, and now he complained that little
Janet was being neglected. She did not love her as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
should or she could not do as she was doing. And what
was more and worse, she had now taken to reading Freud
and Kraft-Ebbing and allied thinkers and authorities, men
and works that he considered dreadful and shameful, even
though he scarcely grasped their true significance.</p>

<p>One day he came to me and said: “Do you know of a
writer by the name of Pierre Loti?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “I know his works. What about him?”</p>

<p>“What do you think of him?”</p>

<p>“As a writer? Why, I respect him very much. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know, from an intellectual point of view, as a
fine writer, maybe. But what do you think of his views of
life—of his books as books to be read by the mother of a
little girl?”</p>

<p>“Wray,” I replied, “I can’t enter upon a discussion of
any man’s works upon purely moral grounds. He might be
good for some mothers and evil for others. Those who are
to be injured by a picture of life must be injured, or kept
from its contaminating influence, and those who are to be
benefited will be benefited. I can’t discuss either books or
life in any other way. I see worthwhile books as truthful
representations of life in some form, nothing more. And it
would be unfair to any one who stood in intellectual need to
be restrained from that which might prove of advantage to
him. I speak only for myself, however.”</p>

<p>It was not long after that I learned there had been a
new quarrel and that Bessie had left him once more, this
time, as it proved, for good. And with her, which was perhaps
illegal or unfair, she had taken the child. I did not
know what had brought about this latest rupture but assumed
that it was due to steadily diverging views. They could not
agree on that better understanding of life which at one time
he was so anxious for her to have—his understanding. Now
that she had gone beyond that, and her method of going was
unsatisfactory to him, they could not agree, of course.</p>

<p>Not hearing from him for a time I called and found him
living in the same large apartment they had taken. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
equipment was better suited to four than to one, yet after
seven or eight months of absence on her part here he was, living
alone, where every single thing must remind him of her
and Janet. As for himself, apart from a solemnity and reserve
which sprang from a wounded and disgruntled spirit,
he pretended an indifference and a satisfaction with his
present state which did not square with his past love for her.
She had gone, yes; but she had made a mistake and would
find it out. Life wasn’t as she thought it was. She had gone
with another man—he was sure of that, although he did not
know who the man was. It was all due to one of those two
women she had taken up with, that Mrs. Drake. They were
always interested in things which did not and could not interest
him. After a time he added that he had been to see
her parents. I could not guess why, unless it was because he
was lonely and still very much in love and thought they
might help him to understand the very troublesome problem
that was before him.</p>

<p>It was a year and a half before I saw him again, during
which time, as I knew, he continued to live in the apartment
they had occupied together. He had become manager of a
department of the agency by this time and was going methodically
to and fro between his home and office. After living
alone and brooding for more than a year, he came to see me
one rainy November night. He looked well enough materially,
quite the careful person who takes care of his clothes,
but thinner, more tense and restless. He seated himself
before my fire and declared that he was doing very well and
was thinking of taking a long vacation to visit some friends
in the West. (He had once told me that he had heard that
Bessie had gone to California.) Yes, he was still living in
the old place. I might think it strange, but he had not
thought it worth while to move. He would only have to
find another place to live in; the furniture was hard to
pack; he didn’t like hotels.</p>

<p>Then of a sudden, noting that I studied him and wondered,
he grew restless and finally stood up, then walked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
about looking at some paintings and examining a shelf of
books. His manner was that of one who is perplexed and
undetermined, of one who has stood out against a silence and
loneliness of which he was intensely weary. Then of a
sudden he wheeled and faced me: “I can’t stand it. That’s
what’s the matter. I just can’t stand it any longer. I’ve
tried and tried. I thought the child would make things
work out all right, but she didn’t. She didn’t want a child
and never forgave me for persuading her to have Janet.
And then that literary craze—that was really my own fault,
though. I was the one that encouraged her to read and go to
theatres. I used to tell her she wasn’t up-to-date, that she
ought to wake up and find out what was going on in the
world, that she ought to get in with intelligent people. But
it wasn’t that either. If she had been the right sort of
woman she couldn’t have done as she did.” He paused and
clenched his hands nervously and dramatically. It was as
though he were denouncing her to her face instead of to me.</p>

<p>“Now, Wray,” I interposed, “how useless to say that.
Which of us is as he should be? Why will you talk so?”</p>

<p>“But let me tell you what she did,” he went on fiercely.
“You haven’t an idea of what I’ve been through, not an
idea. She tried to poison me once so as to get rid of me.”
And here followed a brief and sad recital of the twists and
turns and desperation of one who was intensely desirous of
being free of one who was as desirous of holding her. And
then he added: “And she was in love with another man,
only I could never find out who he was.” And his voice fell
to a low, soft level, as though he was even then trying to
solve the mystery of who it was. “And I know she had an
operation performed, though I could never prove it.” And
he gave me details of certain mysterious goings to and fro,
of secret pursuits on his part, actions and evidences and
moods and quarrels that pointed all too plainly to a breach
that could never be healed. “And what’s more,” he exclaimed
at last, “she tortured me. You’ll never know. You
couldn’t. But I loved her.... And I love her now.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
Once more the tensely gripped fingers, the white face, the
flash of haunted eyes.</p>

<p>“One afternoon I stood outside of a window of an apartment
house when I knew she was inside, and I knew the
name of the man who was supposed to occupy it, only he had
re-sublet it, as I found out afterwards. And she had Janet
with her—think of that!—our own little girl! I saw her
come to the window once to look out—I actually saw her
in another man’s rooms. I ran up and hammered at the door—I
tried to break it open. I called to her to come out but
she wouldn’t, and I went to get a policeman to make him
open the door. But when I got back a servant was coming
up as though she had been out, and she unlocked the door
and went in. It was all a ruse, and I know it. They
weren’t inside. She had slipped out with Janet. And she
had told me they were going to Westchester for the day.</p>

<p>“And another time I followed her to a restaurant when
she said she was going to visit a friend. I suspected there
was a man—the man I thought she was going with, but it
was some one I had never seen before. When they came
out and were getting into a cab I came up and told them
both what I thought of them. I threatened to kill them
both. And she told him to go and then came home with me,
but I couldn’t do anything with her. She wouldn’t talk to
me. All she would say was that if I didn’t like the way she
was doing I could let her go. She wanted me to give her a
divorce. And I couldn’t let her go, even if I had wanted to.
I loved her too much. And I love her too much now. I do.
I can’t help it.” He paused. The pain and regret were
moving.</p>

<p>“Another time,” he went on, “I followed her to a hotel—yes,
to a hotel. But when I got inside she was waiting for
me; she had seen me. I even saw a man coming toward
her—but not the one I believed was the one—only when he
saw me he turned away and I couldn’t be sure that he was
there to meet her. And when I tried to talk to her about
him she turned away from me and we went back home in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
silence. I couldn’t do anything with her. She would sit and
read and ignore me for days—days, I tell you—without ever
a word.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “but the folly of all that. The uselessness,
the hopelessness. How could you?”</p>

<p>“I know, I know,” he exclaimed, “but I couldn’t help it.
I can’t now. I love her. I can’t help that, can I? I’m
miserable without her. I see the folly of it all, but I’m
crazy about her. The more she disliked me the more I
loved her. And I love her now, this minute. I can’t
help it. There were days when she tortured me so that I
vomited, from sheer nervousness. I was sick and run down.
I have been cold with sweat in her presence and when she
was away and I didn’t know where she was. I have walked
the streets for hours, for whole days at a time, because I
couldn’t eat or sleep and didn’t know what to do. By God!”
Once more the pause and a clenching of the hands. “And
all I could do was think and think and think. And that is
all I do now really—think and think and think. I’ve never
been myself since she went away. I can’t shake it off. I
live up there, yes. But why? Because I think she might
come back some day, and because we lived there together.
I wait and wait. I know it’s foolish, but still I wait. Why?
God only knows. And yet I wait. Oh,” he sighed, “and
it’s three years now. Three years!”</p>

<p>He paused and gazed at me and I at him, shaken by a fact
that was without solution by any one. Here he was—the
one who had understood so much about women. But where
was she, the one he had sought to enlighten, to make more
up-to-date and liberal? I wondered where she was, whether
she ever thought of him even, whether she was happy in her
new freedom. And then, without more ado, he slipped on
his raincoat, took up his umbrella, and stalked out into the
rain, to walk and think, I presume. And I, closing the door
on him, studied the walls, wondering. The despair, the
passion, the rage, the hopelessness, the love. “Truly,” I
thought, “this is love, for one at least. And this is marriage,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
for one at least. He is spiritually wedded to that woman,
who despises him, and she may be spiritually wedded to
another man who may despise her. But love and marriage,
for one, at least, I have seen here in this room to-night, and
with mine own eyes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="XI">XI<br>
FULFILMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Hearing</span> the maid tap lightly on her door for the
third or fourth time, Ulrica uttered a semiconscious
“Come.” It was her usual rising hour but to-day she was
more depressed than usual, although the condition was
common enough at all times. The heavy drag of a troubled
mental state was upon her. Was it never to end?
Was she never to be happy again? After several weeks
of a decidedly acceptable loneliness, during which Harry
had been in the west looking after his interminable interests,
he was about to return. The weariness of that, to
begin with! And while she could not say that she really
hated or even disliked him deeply (he was too kind and
considerate for that), still his existence, his able and different
personality, constantly forced or persuaded upon her,
had come to be a bore. The trouble was that she did not
truly love him and never could. He might be, as he was,
rich, resourceful and generous to a fault in her case, a man
whom the world of commerce respected, but how did that
avail her? He was not her kind of man. Vivian before
him had proved that. And other men had been and would
be as glad to do as much if not more.</p>

<p>Vivian had given all of himself in a different way. Only
Harry’s seeking, begging eyes pleading with her (after
Vivian’s death and when she was so depressed) had preyed
upon and finally moved her to sympathy. Life had not
mattered then, (only her mother and sister), and she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
become too weary to pursue any career, even for them. So
Harry with his wealth and anxiety to do for her—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(The maid entered softly, drew back the curtains and
raised the blinds, letting in a flood of sunshine, then
proceeded to arrange the bath.)</p>
</div>

<p>It had been, of course, because of the magic of her
beauty—how well she knew the magic of that!—plus an
understanding and sympathy she had for the miseries Harry
had endured in his youth, that had caused him to pursue
her with all the pathetic vehemence of a man of fifty. He
was not at all like Vivian, who had been shy and retiring.
Life had seemed to frighten poor Vivian and drive him
in upon himself in an uncomplaining and dignified way.
In Harry’s case it had acted contrariwise. Some men were
so, especially the old and rich, those from whom life was
slipping away and for whom youth, their lost youth, seemed
to remain a colored and enthralling spectacle however
wholly gone. The gifts he had lavished upon her, the cars,
the jewels, this apartment, stocks and bonds, even that house
in Seadale for her sister and mother! And all because of a
beauty that meant so little to her now that Vivian was gone,
and in the face of an indifference so marked that it might
well have wearied any man.</p>

<p>How could she go on? (She paused in her thoughts
to survey and follow her maid, who was calling for the
second time.) Though he hung upon her least word or
wish and was content to see her at her pleasure, to run her
errands and be ever deferential and worshipful, still she
could not like him, could barely tolerate him. Before her
always now was Vivian with his brooding eyes and elusive,
sensitive smile; Vivian, who had never a penny to bless
himself with. She could see him now striding to and fro in
his bare studio, a brush in one hand, or sitting in his crippled
chair meditating before a picture or talking to her of ways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
and means which might be employed to better their state.
The pathos!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>I cannot endure that perfume, Olga!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>In part she could understand her acceptance of Harry
after Vivian (only it did not seem understandable always,
even to her), for in her extreme youth her parents had been
so very poor. Perhaps because of her longings and childish
fears in those days she had been marked in some strange
way that had eventually led her to the conviction that wealth
was so essential. For her parents were certainly harassed
from her sixth to her thirteenth years, when they recovered
themselves in part. Some bank or concern had failed and
they had been thrown on inadequate resources and made
to shift along in strange ways. She could remember an
old brick house with a funereal air and a weedy garden into
which they had moved and where for a long time they were
almost without food. Her mother had cried more than once
as she sat by the open window looking desolately out, while
Ulrica, not quite comprehending what it was all about, had
stared at her from an adjacent corner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Will madame have the iris or the Japanese lilac in the
water?</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>She recalled going downtown once on an errand and
slipping along shyly because her clothes were not good.
And when she saw some schoolgirls approaching, hid behind
a tree so they should not see her. Another time, passing the
Pilkington at dinner-time, the windows being open and
the diners visible, she had wondered what great persons
they must be to be able to bask in so great a world. It was
then perhaps that she had developed the obsession for wealth
which had led to this. If only she could have seen herself as
she now was she would not have longed so. (She paused,
looking gloomily back into the past.) And then had come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
the recovery of her father in some way or other. He had
managed to get an interest in a small stove factory and they
were no longer so poor—but that was after her youth had
been spoiled, her mind marked in this way.</p>

<p>And to crown it all, at seventeen had come Byram the
inefficient. And because he was “cute” and had a suggestion
of a lisp; was of good family and really insane over her,
as nearly every youth was once she had turned fourteen, she
had married him, against her parents’ wishes, running away
with him and lying about her age, as did he about his. And
then had come trying times. Byram was no money-maker, as
she might have known. He was inexperienced, and being
in disfavor with his parents for ignoring them in his hasty
choice of a wife, he was left to his own devices. For two
whole years what had she not endured—petty wants which
she had concealed from her mother, furniture bought on
time and dunned for, collectors with whom she had to
plead not to take the stove or the lamp or the parlor table,
and grocery stores and laundries and meat-markets which
had to be avoided because of unpaid bills. There had even
been an ejectment for non-payment of rent, and job after
job lost for one reason and another, until the whole experiment
had been discolored and made impossible even after
comfort had been restored.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>I cannot endure the cries of the children, Olga. You will
have to close that window.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>No; Byram was no money-maker, not even after his
parents in far-distant St. Paul had begun to help him to do
better. And anyhow by then, because she had had time to
sense how weak he was, what a child, she was weary of him,
although he was not entirely to blame. It was life. And
besides, during all that time there had been the most urgent
pursuit of her by other men, men of the world and of means,
who had tried to influence her with the thought of how easily
her life could be made more agreeable. Why remain faithful
to so young and poor a man when so much could be done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
for her. But she had refused. Despite Byram’s lacks she
had small interest in them, although their money and skill
had succeeded in debasing Byram in her young and untrained
imagination, making him seem even weaker and more
ridiculous than he was. But that was all so long ago now
and Vivian had proved so much more important in her life.
While even now she was sorry for Harry and for Byram she
could only think of Vivian, who was irretrievably gone.
Byram was successful now and out of her life, but maybe
if life had not been so unkind and they so foolish——</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>You may have Henry serve breakfast and call the car!</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And then after Byram had come Newton, big, successful,
important, a quondam employer of Byram, who had met her
on the street one day when she was looking for work, just
when she had begun to sense how inefficient Byram really
was, and he had proved kind without becoming obnoxious
or demanding. While declaring, and actually proving,
that he wished nothing more of her than her good-will, he
had aided her with work, an opportunity to make her own
way. All men were not selfish. He had been the vice-president
of the Dickerson Company and had made a place
for her in his office, saying that what she did not know he
would teach her since he needed a little sunshine there.
And all the while her interest in Byram was waning, so
much so that she had persuaded him to seek work elsewhere
so that she might be rid of him, and then she had gone home
to live with her mother. And Newton would have married
her if she had cared, but so grieved was she by the outcome
of her first love and marriage that she would not.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>The sedan, yes. And I will take my furs.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And then, living with her mother and making her own
way, she had been sought by others. But there had been
taking root and growing in her an ideal which somehow in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
the course of time had completely mastered her and would
not even let her think of anything else, save in moments
of loneliness and the natural human yearning for life. This
somehow concerned some one man, not any one she knew,
not any one she was sure she would ever meet, but one so
wonderful and ideal that for her there could be no other
like him. He was not to be as young or unsophisticated
as Byram, nor as old and practical as Newton, though possibly
as able (though somehow this did not matter), but wise
and delicate, a spirit-mate, some such wondrous thing as a
great musician or artist might be, yet to whom in spite of
his greatness she was to be all in all. She could not have
told herself then how she was to have appealed to him, unless
somehow surely, because of her great desire for him, her
beauty and his understanding of her need. He was to have
a fineness of mind and body, a breadth, a grasp, a tenderness
of soul such as she had not seen except in pictures and
dreams. And such as would need her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>To Thorne and Company’s first, Fred.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Somewhere she had seen pictures of Lord Byron, of
Shelley, Liszt and Keats, and her soul had yearned over
each, the beauty of their faces, the record of their dreams
and seekings, their something above the common seeking and
clayiness (she understood that now). They were of a
world so far above hers. But before Vivian appeared, how
long a journey! Life had never been in any hurry for her.
She had gone on working and seeking and dreaming, the
while other men had come and gone. There had been, for
instance, Joyce with whom, had she been able to tolerate
him, she might have found a life of comfort in so far as
material things went. He was, however, too thin or limited
spiritually to interest a stirring mind such as hers, a material
man, and yet he had along with his financial capacity
more humanity than most, a kind of spiritual tenderness
and generosity at times towards some temperaments. But no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
art, no true romance. He was a plunger in real estate, a
developer of tracts. And he lacked that stability and worth
of temperament which even then she was beginning to sense
as needful to her, whether art was present or not. He was
handsomer than Byram, a gallant of sorts, active and ebullient,
and always he seemed to sense, as might a homing
pigeon, the direction in which lay his own best financial
opportunities and to be able to wing in that direction. But
beyond that, what? He was not brilliant mentally, merely
a clever “mixer” and maker of money, and she was a little
weary of men who could think only in terms of money.
How thin some clever men really were!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>I rather like that. I’ll try it on.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And so it had been with him as it had been with Byram
and Newton, although he sought her eagerly enough! and so
it was afterward with Edward and Young. They were all
worthy men in their way. No doubt some women would
be or already had been drawn to them and now thought
them wonderful. Even if she could have married any one
of them it would only have been to have endured a variation
of what she had endured with Byram; with them it
would have been of the mind instead of the purse, which
would have been worse. For poor Byram, inefficient and inexperienced
as he was, had had some little imagination and
longings above the commonplace. But these, as contrasted
with her new ideal——</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Yes, the lines of this side are not bad.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Yes, in those days there had come to her this nameless
unrest, this seeking for something better than anything she
had yet known and which later, without rhyme or reason,
had caused her to be so violently drawn to Vivian. Why
had Vivian always grieved so over her earlier affairs? They
were nothing, and she regretted them once she knew him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Yes, you may send me this one, and the little one with
the jade pins.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And then after Young had come Karel, the son of rich
parents and well-placed socially in Braleigh. He was young,
well-informed, a snob of sorts, although a gentle one. The
only world he knew was that in which his parents had been
reared. Their ways had been and always would be his, conservatism
run mad. At thirty the only place to go in summer
was Macomber Beach, and in winter the only place to be was
in Braleigh. There he could meet his equals twenty times a
day. They went to the same homes, the same hotels, the
same parties the year round. It was all the life he wanted,
and it was all the life she would have been expected to want.
But by then she was being hopelessly held by this greater
vision and something within had said: “No, no, no!”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>You were making over my ermine cape. Is it finished?</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And Loring! He, for a change, was a physician
there in Braleigh and lived with his sister in Lankester
Way, near her home, only hers was in a cheaper street.
He was young and good-looking but seemed to think only
of his practice, how it was to make him and achieve her
perhaps, although it had all seemed so commonplace and
practical to her. He was so keen as to his standing with
the best people, always so careful of his ways and appearance,
as though his life depended upon it. He might have
married more to his social and financial advantage but he
had wanted her. And she had never been able to endure him—never
seriously tolerate his pursuit.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Yes, if you would alter these sleeves I might like it.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Whenever he saw her he would come hustling up. “My,
but it’s nice to see you again, Ulrica. You are always the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
same, always charming, always beautiful—now don’t frown.
Have you changed your mind yet, Ulrica? You don’t want
to forget that I’m going to be one of the successful men here
some day. Please do smile a little for me. I’ll be just as
successful as Joyce or any of them.”</p>

<p>“And is it just success you think I want?” she had asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I know it isn’t just that, but I’ve had a hard time
and so have you. I know it wouldn’t do any good to offer
you only success, but what I mean is that it makes everything
so much easier. With you I could do anything—”
and so he would ramble on.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>To McCafferey’s, the Post Street entrance.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>But the shrewd hard eyes and dapper figure and unvaried
attention to <em>his interests</em> had all bored and after a
time alienated her, since her ideal seemed to dwarf and discolor
every one and everything. Was there not something
somewhere much bigger than all this, these various and
unending men, she had asked herself, some man not necessarily
so successful financially but different? She had felt
that she would find him somewhere, must indeed if her life
was to mean anything to her. Always her great asset, her
beauty, had been looked upon as the one thing she must keep
for this other. And so it had gone, man after man and
flirtation after flirtation. It had seemed as though it would
never end. Even after she had transferred her life to the
great city, to work, to go upon the stage if need be, there
were more of these endless approaches and recessions; but,
like the others, they had come and gone, leaving only a faint
impression. Not until that day at Althea’s party in the
rooming-house in which they both lived had she found the
one who touched her.</p>

<p>And then—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>And now to the Willoughby.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>It was late afternoon and just as she was returning from
her task of seeking work in connection with the stage that
they met. There he was in Althea’s room, tall, spare,
angular, slightly sallow and cloisterish, his heavy eyebrows
low above his sunken eyes as though he sought to shut
himself in to himself, and with those large dark eyes fixed
ruminatively and yet somewhat uncertainly upon all, even
her when she came. And from Althea she gathered that
he was a painter of strange dark landscapes and decorations
which many of those who knew seemed to think were wonderful
but which as yet had achieved no recognition at all.
Worse, he was from the Rockies, a sheep-rancher’s son, but
had not been able to endure ranching. His future was still
very far before him, and, as one could sense, he was so innocent
of any desire to be put forward; he seemed half the time
to be a—dream. By some strange freak of luck he was still
there when she entered, sitting in a corner not entirely at
ease, because, as he told her later, he was strange to such
affairs and did not know when to go.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The brightness of the buildings in the spring sun!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And she had looked at his hands, at his commonplace
clothes, and then, a little troubled by his gaze, had withdrawn
hers. Again and again her eyes sought his or his hers,
as though they were furtively surveying each other; as
though each was unable to keep his eyes off the other. And
by degrees there was set up in her a tremendous something
that was like music and fear combined, as though all at once
she had awakened and comprehended. She was no longer the
complete master of herself, as she had always imagined, but
was now seized upon and possessed by this stranger! In brief,
here he was, her dream, and now she could do nothing save
gaze nervously and appealingly—for what? Those dark,
sombre eyes, the coarse black hair and sallow skin! Yes, it
was he indeed, her love, her star, the one by whose mystic
light she had been steering her course these many years. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
sensed it. Knew it. He was here before her now as though
saying: “Come.” And she could only smile foolishly without
speaking. Her hands trembled and her throat tightened until
she almost choked. “I never saw any one more beautiful
than you,” he had said afterwards when they talked, and she
had thrilled so that it was an effort not to cry out. And then
he had sighed like a child and said: “Talk to me, about anything—but
don’t go, will you?”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The air—the air—this day!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And so, realizing that he valued her for this one gift at
least, her beauty, she had sought now to make him understand
that she was his without, however, throwing herself
beggingly before him. With her eyes, her smile, her every
gesture, she had said: “I am yours! I am yours! Can’t you
see?” At last, in his shy way, he had seemed to comprehend,
but even then, as he afterwards confessed, he could not
believe that anything so wonderful could follow so speedily
upon contact, that one could love, adore, at sight. She had
asked where he lived and if she might come and see his work,
and with repressed intensity he had said: “I wish you would!
I wish you could come to-day!” It had made her sad and yet
laugh, too, for joy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>That single tree blooming in this long, hard block!</em></p>
</div>

<p>There and then, with only the necessary little interludes
which propriety seemed to demand, and with longing and
seeking on the part of each, had begun that wondrous thing,
their love. Only it seemed to have had no fixed beginning,—to
have been always—just been. For the day she had called
him up his voice had so thrilled her that she could scarcely
speak. She had still felt she had known him for so long.
How could that have been?</p>

<p>“I was afraid you might not call,” he had said tremulously,
and she had replied: “And I was wondering if you
really wanted me to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span></p>

<p>And when she sought him out in his studio she had found
it to be such a poor mean room over a stable, in a mean
street among a maze of mean streets, and yet had thought it
heaven. It was so like him, so bare and yet wonderful—a
lovely spiritual mood set over against tawdry materials
and surroundings.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Drive me through the East Side, Fred.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Better, she had found him painting or perhaps merely pretending
to. He had on that old long gray linen duster which
later became so familiar a thing to her. And to one side of
him and his easel on a table were some of the colors of his
palette, greens and purples and browns and blues. He had
said so softly as he opened the door to her: “My painting is
all bluffing to-day. I haven’t been able to think of anything
but you, how you might not come, how you would look—”
And then, without further introduction or explanation,
under the north light of his roof window filtering down
dustily upon them, he had put his arms about her and she
her lips to his, and they had clung together, thinking only
of each other, their joy and their love. And he had sighed,
a tired sigh, or one of great relief after a strain, such a strain
as she herself had been under.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>That one little cloud in the sky!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And then after a time, he had shown her the picture he
was painting, a green lush sea-marsh with a ribbon of dark
enamel-like water laving the mucky strand, and overhead
heavy, sombre, smoky clouds, those of a sultry summer day
over a marsh. And in the distance, along the horizon, a
fringe of trees showing as a filigree. But what a mood!
Now it hung in the Wakefield Gallery—and— (Harry had
helped to place it there for her!) But then he had said,
putting his brushes aside: “But what is the use of trying
to paint now that you are here?” And she had sighed for
joy, so wonderful was it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The crowds in these East Side streets!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Yet what had impressed her most was that he made no
apology for the bareness and cheapness of his surroundings.
Outside were swarming push carts and crowds, the babble
of the great foreign section, but it was all as though he did
not hear. Over a rack at the back of the large bare room he
had hung a strip of faded burnt orange silk and another of
clear light green, which vivified what otherwise would have
been dusty and gray. Behind this, as she later discovered,
were his culinary and sleeping worlds.</p>

<p>And then, of course, had come other days.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>But how like that first day was this one, so fresh and
bright!</em></p>
</div>

<p>There was no question here of what was right or wrong,
conventional or otherwise. This was love, and this her
beloved. Had she not sought him in the highways and the
byways? At the close of one afternoon, as she was insisting
that she must continue her search for work, now more than
ever since neither he nor she had anything, he had said
sadly: “Don’t go. We need so little, Ulrica. Don’t. I
can’t stand it now.” And she had come back. “No,” she
had replied, “I won’t—I can’t—not any more, if you
want me.”</p>

<p>And she had stayed.</p>

<p>And that wondrous, beautiful love-life! The only love-life
she had ever known.</p>

<p>But just the same she had seen that she must redouble her
efforts to make her way, and had. Six hundred dollars she
had brought to the city was nearly all gone, and as for
Vivian, his allotment was what he could earn, a beggar’s
dole. During the days that followed, each bringing them
closer, he had confessed more and more of the difficulties
that confronted him, how hard it was to sell his wares.
And she—it was needful for her to reopen the pages of
her past. She had not been happy or prosperous, she told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
him; fortune might have been hers for the taking but she
could not endure those who came with it. Now that she
had the misery of her soul’s ache removed she must find
something to do. The stage was her great opportunity.
And plainly his life was one which had always been and
must be based on the grudged dole that life offers to those
who love its beauty and lift their eyes. So few, as yet,
knew of his work or had been arrested by it. Yet if he
persisted, as she felt,—if that wondrous something in his
work which had attracted the sensitive and selective did
not fail—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The hot, bare redness of the walls of these streets, so
flowerless, so bleak, and yet so alive and human!</em></p>
</div>

<p>But all too well she understood that his life, unless
changed by her, would ever be the meagre thing it had been.
Beauty was his, but no more,—a beauty of mind and of
dreams and of the streets and the night and the sea and the
movements of life itself, but of that which was material he
had nothing. That was for those whom she had been unable
to endure. Only by a deft synthesis of those wondrous
faculties which concern beauty was he able to perceive, respond
to, translate the things which he saw and felt, and
these were not of matter. Rather, they were epitomes, his
pictures, of lands and skies and seas and strange valleys of
dreams, worlds in miniature. But what transmutations and
transferences! She was never weary of the pictures he
made. Nor was she ever weary of the picture he made
before his easel, tenuous and pale and concerned, his graceful
hands at work with the colors he synthetized. The patience,
the stability, the indifference to all but that which
was his to do!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>Into Bartow Street, Fred.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And in him, too, was no impatience with life for anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
it might have failed to provide. Instead, he seemed ever to
be thinking of its beauties and harmonies, the wonder of its
dawns and sunsets, the colors and harmonies of its streets,
buildings, crowds, silences. Often of a morning when it
was yet dark he would arise and open a door that gave out
onto a balcony and from there gaze upon the sky and city.
And at any time it was always an instinct with him to pause
before anything that appealed to either of them as beautiful
or interesting. And in his eye was never the estimating
glint of one who seeks to capture for profit that which is
elemental and hence evanescent, but only the gaze of the
lover of beauty, the worshiper of that which is profitable
to the soul only.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The very street! The very studio!</em></p>
</div>

<p>Although she was ignorant of the spirit or the technique
of art she had been able to comprehend it and him, all that
he represented as a portion of beauty itself, the vast and
supernal beauty toward which the creative forces of life in
their harsh and yet tender ways seem impelled at times.</p>

<p>Had she not understood very well that it was as beauty
that she appealed to him, at first anyhow, an artistry of face
and form plus a certain mood of appreciation or adoration
or understanding which was of value to him? How often
had he spoken of her lavender-lidded eyes, the whiteness and
roundness of her arms, the dark gold of her hair, the sombre
unrevealing blue of the iris of her eyes! Here strange it
was that these seemed to enthrall and hold him at times,
leaving him, if not weak, at least childlike in her hands. He
had never seemed to weary of her and during all their days
together she could feel his unreasoning joy in her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>His one-time yellow curtains exchanged for green ones!</em></p>
</div>

<p>That she had proved and remained irresistible to him was
evidenced by his welcoming and gratified eyes, the manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
in which he paused to survey her whenever she came near,
seeming to re-estimate her every least attribute with loving
interest. Indeed, he seemed to need her as much as she
needed him, to yearn with an intense hunger over her as
a thing of beauty,—he who to her was strength, beauty,
ideals, power, all the substance of beauty and delight that
she could crave.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Yes, here was where they had come to gaze at the towers
of the bridge beyond.</em></p>
</div>

<p>And so for over a year it was that they clung together,
seeking to make of their lives an ideal thing. Only it was
after she came into his life that he had begun to worry—and
because of what? It was no hardship for him to live
upon what he could make, but now that she had come, with
her beauty and her beauty’s needs, it was no longer the
same. As soon as she appeared he had seemed to sense his
inefficiency as a creator of means. Bowdler, the wealthy
dealer, had once told him that if he pleased him with something
it might be worth five hundred dollars. Five hundred
dollars! But when he took a painting to Bowdler he said
he was overstocked, had too many of his things on hand—the
very things that to-day—(now that Vivian was gone) —were
selling for as much as ten and twelve thousand! And
a single one of all those now being sold would have made
them both happy for a whole year or more!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>He had called this tree her parasol!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And she had been able to do so little for him! Realizing
how little life had done for him she had decided then and
there that all her efforts must be bent toward correcting
this injustice. Life owed him more. And so it was that
at last she had turned to the stage and sought earnestly, day
after day and week after week, only to obtain very little
of all she needed to make them happy, a small part in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
of Wexford’s many productions, he of the comedies and
farces and beauty shows. Yet after some effort she had
made him admit that she was distinctive and that he could
use her. But then had come that long wait of nearly three
months before the work began! And in the meantime
what labor, the night and day work of rehearsals and appearances,
the trying to get back to him each afternoon or
night. And he had been so patient and hopeful and helpful,
waiting for her after late hours of rehearsal to walk
home with her and encouraging her in every way. And
yet always there was a tang of something unreal about it all,
hopes, as she so truly feared, that were never to be
realized, dreams too good to come true. The hours had
flown. The very pressure of his hand had suggested paradise,
present and yet not to be.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>She must be returning now. It was not wise for her to
sit here alone.</em></p>
</div>

<p>And while those three months were dragging their slow
days she had borrowed what money she could to keep them
going. She had even borrowed from her mother! Yet they
had been happy, wandering here and there, he always rejoicing
in the success which her work promised to bring
her. The studios facing the great park where she now
lived at which they had looked, he seeming to think they
were not for such as he. (The creatures who really dwelt
there!)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Yes, she must be going. His train was due at four.</em></p>
</div>

<p>And then at last, her trial period was over, Wexford had
complimented her and her salary had been increased. She
had begun to buy things for Vivian and his studio, much
as he protested. But best of all for her the hope of better
days still to come, greater fame for herself and so better
days for Vivian, a real future in which he was to share—money,—comfort
for them both.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>To the apartment, Fred.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And then—In spite of all her wishes and fears, had
come the necessity for her to go on the road with the show.
And owing to their limited means he was compelled to remain
behind. Worse, despite the fact that each knew that
every thought was for the other, the thought of separation
tortured them both. Wherever she was there was the
thought of him, alone, at his easel and brooding. And herself
alone. It had seemed at times as though she must die unless
this separation could be ended.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>If only Harry were not coming into her life again!</em></p>
</div>

<p>But it was not ended—for weeks. And then one day, after
a brief silence had come the word that he had been ill. A
wave of influenza was sweeping the city and had seized him.
She was not to worry. But she did worry—and returned
immediately, only to find him far along the path which he
was never to retrace. He was so ill. And worse, a strange
despondency based on the thought that he was never to get
well, had seized him. He had felt when she left, or so he
said, that something were sure to happen. They might
not ever, really, be together again. It had been so hard
for him to do without her.</p>

<p>He had added that he was sorry to be so poor a fighter,
to bring her back from her work. Her work! And he ill!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>The immense wall these hotels made along the park!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And then against the utmost protest of her soul had come
the end, a conclusion so sudden and unexpected that it had
driven despair like metal into her very soul. Hour after
hour and under her very eyes, her protesting if not restraining
hands and thoughts, he had grown weaker.
Though he knew, he seemed to wish to deny it, until at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
last his big dear eyes fixed upon her, he had gone, looking
as though he wished to say something.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>This wretchedly wealthy West Side!</em></p>
</div>

<p>It was that look, the seeking in it, that wishing to remain
with her that was written there, that had haunted
her and did still. It was as though he had wished to say:
“I do not want to go! I do not want to go!”</p>

<p>And then, half-dead, she had flung herself upon him.
With her hands she had tried to draw him back, until she
was led away. For days she was too ill to know, and only
his grave—chosen by strangers!—had brought it all back.
And then the long days! Never again would life be the
same. For the first time in her life she had been happy.
A bowl of joy had been placed in her eager fingers, only
to be dashed from them. Yes, once more now she was
alone and would remain so, thrust back upon herself. And
worse, with the agonizing knowledge of what beauty might
be. Life had lost its lustre. What matter if others told
of her beauty, if one or many sought to make her life less
bare?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>This stodgy porter always at the door in his showy braid!
Why might not such as he die instead?</em></p>
</div>

<p>But then her mother and sister, learning of her despair,
had come to her. Only since there was nothing that any
pleasure, or aspect of life could offer her, the days rolled
drearily,—meaninglessly. And only because of what was
still missing in her mother’s life, material comfort, had she
changed. It had been with the thought of helping her
mother that after a year she had returned to the city and
the stage, but exhausted, moping, a dreary wanderer amid
old and broken dreams.</p>

<p>By degrees of course she had managed to pick up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
threads of her life again. Who did not? And now nature,
cynical, contemptuous of the dreams and longings which
possess men, now lavished upon her that which she and
Vivian had longed for in vain. Fame? It was hers.
Money? A Score of fortunes had sought her in vain.
Friendship? She could scarcely drive it from the door. She
was successful.</p>

<p>But what mattered it now? Was it not a part of the
routine, shabby method of life to first disappoint one—sweat
and agonize one—and then lavish luxury upon one,—afterwards?</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>I want nothing. And if any one calls, I am not in.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>And so it was that after a time Harry descending upon
her with his millions, and seeking solace for himself through
her sympathy, she had succumbed to that—or him—as a
kindly thing to do. He too had confessed to a wretched dole
of difficulties that had dogged his early years. He too had
been disappointed in love, comfort—almost everything until
too late. In his earliest years he had risen at four in a mill-town
to milk cows and deliver milk, only later to betake
himself, barefooted and in the snow, to a mill to work.
Later still he had worked in a jewelry factory, until his
lungs had failed. And had then taken to the open road as
a peripatetic photographer of street children in order to recover
his health. But because of this work—the chemistry, and
physics of photography—he had interested himself in chemistry
and physics—later taking a “regular job,” as he phrased
it, in a photographic supply house and later still opening a
store of his own. It was here that he had met Kesselbloom,
who had solved the mystery of the revolving shutter and
the selenium bath. Financing him and his patents, he had
been able to rise still more, to fly really, as though others
were standing still. The vast Dagmar Optical and Photographic
Company. It was now his, with all its patents.
And the Baker-Wile Chemical Company. Yes, now he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
was a multimillionaire, and lonely—as lonely as she was.
Strange that he and she should have met.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>No, I will not see any one.</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>So now, through her, he was seeking the youth which
could be his no more. Because of some strange sense of
comradeship in misery, perhaps, they had agreed to share
each other’s unhappiness!</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em>You say Mr. Harris telephoned from the station?</em>”</p>
</div>

<p>Yes, as he had told her in his brooding hours, at fifty it
had suddenly struck him that his plethora of wealth was
pointless. As a boy he had not learned to play, and now it
was too late. Already he was old and lonely. Where lay
his youth or any happiness?</p>

<p>And so now—nearly icy-cold the two of them, and contemning
life dreams—they were still facing life together.
And here he was this day, at her door or soon would be,
fresh from financial labors in one city and another. And
returning to what? With a kind of slavish and yet royal
persistence he still pursued her—to comfort—as well as to
be comforted, and out of sheer weariness she endured him.
Perhaps because he was willing to await her mood, to accept
the least crumb of her favor as priceless. The only
kinship that existed between them was this unhappy youth
of his and her sympathy for it, and his seeming understanding
of and sympathy for the ills that had beset her.
Supposing (so his argument had run) that the burden of
this proposed friendship with him were to be made very
light, the lightest of all burdens, that upon closer contact
he proved not so hopeless or dull as he appeared, could she
not—would she not—endure him? (The amazing contrarieties
and strangenesses of things!) And so friendship, and
later marriage under these strange conditions. Yet she
could not love him, never had and never would. However<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span>
it might have seemed at first—and she did sympathize with
and appreciate him—still only because of her mother and
sister and the fact that she herself needed some one to fall
back upon, a support in this dull round of living, had caused
her to go on as long as she had.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>How deserted that wading-pool looked at evening, with
all the children gone!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And now at this very moment he was below stairs waiting
for her, waiting to learn whether she had smiled or her
mood had relaxed so that he might come up to plead afresh
for so little as she could give—her worthless disinterested
company somewhere!</p>

<p>Well, perhaps it was unfair to serve one so who wished
nothing more than to be kind and who had striven in every
way for several years now to make himself useful if not
agreeable to her, and yet—True, she had accepted of his
largess, not only for herself but for her mother; but had she
not had things of her own before that? And had she not
been content? Was it charity from her or from him?</p>

<p>And still—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Those darkening shadows in the sky in the east!</em></p>
</div>

<p>And yet it was always “Ulrica” here and “Ulrica” there.
Did she so much as refer to an old-time longing was it not
he who attempted to make amends in some way or to bring
about a belated fulfilment? Vivian’s painting now in the
museum, the talk as to his worth, his monument but now
being erected—to whom, to whom were those things due—this
belated honoring of her darling—?</p>

THE VICTOR</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Some excerpts from an article on the late J. H. Osterman,
by C. A. Gridley, Chief Engineer of the Osterman Development
Company. This article appeared in the Engineering
Record, for August last.</p>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“My</span> admiration for the late J. H. Osterman was based
on his force and courage and initiative, rather than
upon his large fortune and the speed with which he had
accumulated it after he had passed the age of forty. Mr.
Osterman was not always a pleasant person to be near. Not
that he was given to violent rages, but in the prosecution
of his various enterprises he had the faculty of giving one
the impression that but a fraction of his thoughts was being
revealed and that he was sitting apart and in judgment
upon one, as it were, even while he talked. He had the
habit of extracting the most carefully thought-out opinions
of all those about him, and when all had been said of shaking
his head and dismissing the whole matter as negligible, only
to make use of the advice in some form later. At such
times he was apt to convince himself, and quite innocently,
I am sure, that his final opinion was his own.</p>

<p>“In so far as I could judge from hearsay and active contact
with him for a period of something like fourteen years,
Mr. Osterman was one who required little if any rest and
at all times much work to keep him content. His was an
intense and always dominant personality. Even after he
had passed the age of sixty-five, when most men of means are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
content to rest and let others assume the strenuous burdens
of the world, he was always thinking of some new thing to
do. It was only the week before he died, stricken while
walking upon his verandah, that he was in my office with a
plan to subsidize the reigning authorities of a certain minor
Asiatic state, in order that certain oil and other properties
there might be developed under peaceful conditions. A
part of this plan contemplated a local army to be organized
and equipped and maintained at his expense. Of a related
nature was his plan for the double-screw platform descents
and exits for the proposed New York-New Jersey traffic
tunnel, which he appears to have worked out during the
spring which preceded his sudden demise and plans for
which he was most anxious to have this department prepare
in order that they might be submitted to the respective
states. It is hardly needful to state, since the fact is generally
known, that those plans have been accepted. Of a
related nature were those Argentine-Chilean Trans-Andean
railway projects so much discussed in the technical engineering
as well as the trade papers of a few years since, and which
recently have been jointly financed by the two governments.
Only the natural tact and diplomacy of a man like Mr.
Osterman, combined with his absolute genius for detecting
and organizing the natural though oftentimes difficult resources
of a country, would have been capable of making
anything out of that very knotty problem. It was too much
identified with diplomacy and the respective ambitions and
prejudices of the countries involved. Yet it was solved and
he succeeded in winning for his South American organization
the confidence and friendship of the two governments.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The facts concerning the founding and development of
the fortune of the late J. H. Osterman, as developed by
C. B. Cummings, quondam secretary to Mr. Osterman,
special investigator for E. X. Bush, of counsel for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
minority stockholders of the C. C. and Q. L., in their
suit to compel the resale of the road to the original holders
and the return of certain moneys alleged to have been
illegally abstracted by J. H. Osterman and Frank O. Parm,
of Parm-Baggott and Company, and by him set forth in
his reminiscences of Mr. Bush and the Osterman-Parm-C.
C. &amp; Q. L. imbroglio.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>1. The details of the Osterman-De Malquit matter were,
as near as I have been able to gather, or recall, since I was
Mr. Osterman’s secretary until that time, as follows: De
Malquit was one of the many curb brokers in New York
dabbling in rubber and other things at the time Osterman
returned from Honduras and executed his very dubious
coup. The afternoon before De Malquit killed himself—and
this fact was long held against Mr. Osterman in connection
with his sudden rise—he had come to Osterman’s
office in Broad Street, and there, amid rosewood and mahogany
and an unnecessary show of luxury which Osterman
appeared to relish even at that time, had pleaded for time
in which to meet a demand for one hundred thousand dollars
due for ten thousand shares of Calamita Rubber, which
Osterman then entirely controlled and for which he was
demanding the par or face value. And this in spite of the
fact that it had been selling on “curb” only the day before
for seven and one-fourth and seven and three-fourths. De
Malquit was one of those curb brokers whom Osterman,
upon coming to New York and launching Calamita (which
was built on nothing more solid than air), had deliberately
plotted to trap in this way. Unwitting of Osterman’s
scheme, he had sold ten thousand shares of Calamita on
margin at the above low price without troubling to have the
same in his safe, as Osterman well knew. That was what
Osterman had been counting on and it had pleased him to see
De Malquit, along with many others just at that moment, in
the very same difficult position. For up to that day Calamita,
like many another of its kind, had been a wildcat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
stock. Only “wash sales” were traded in by brokers in
order to entrap the unwary from the outside. They traded
in it without ever buying any of it. It had to fluctuate so
that the outsider might be induced to buy, and that was
why it was traded in. But when it did fluctuate and the
lamb approached, he was sold any quantity he wished, the
same being entered upon their books as having been sold or
bought on his order. When a quotation sufficiently low to
wipe out the margin exacted had been engineered among
friends, the lamb was notified that he must either post more
money to cover the decline or retire. In quite all cases
the lamb retired, leaving the broker with a neat profit.</p>

<p>This was the very situation upon which Osterman had
been counting to net him the fortune which it eventually
did, and overnight at that. Unknown to the brokers, he
had long employed agents whose business it was to permit
themselves to be fleeced for small sums in order that these
several brokers, growing more and more careless and finding
this stock to be easy and a money-maker, should sell enough
of it without actually having it in their safes to permit
him to pounce upon them unexpectedly and make them pay
up. And so they did. The promoters of the stock seeming
indifferent or unable to manage their affairs, these fake
sales became larger and larger, a thousand and finally a
ten thousand share margin sale being not uncommon. When
the stage was set the trap was sprung. Overnight, as it
were, all those who at Osterman’s order had bought the
stock on margin (and by then some hundreds of thousands
of dollars’ worth had been disposed of) decided that they
would not lose their margins but would follow up their
cash with more and take the stock itself, holding it as an
investment. It then became the duty of these brokers to
deliver the stock within twenty-four hours or take the consequences—say,
a petition in bankruptcy or a term in jail.
Naturally there was a scrambling about to find any loose
blocks of the stock. But these had been carefully garnered
into the safe of Mr. Osterman, who was the sole owner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
the stock, and they were compelled to hurry eventually to
him. Here they were met by the genial eye of the cat that
is expecting the mouse. They wanted Calamita, did they?
Well, they could have it, all they wanted ... at par or
a little more. Did that seem harsh, seeing that it had been
selling only the day before for seven and three-fourths or
seven-eighths? Sorry. That was the best he could do.
They could take it at that price or leave it.</p>

<p>Naturally there was a panic among those who were short.
The trick was obvious, but so was the law. Those who
could, pocketed their losses without undue complaint and
departed; some who could not, and were financially unimportant,
decamped, leaving Osterman’s agents to collect as
best they might. Only one, Mr. De Malquit, finding himself
faced by complications which he could not meet, took
his own life. He had unfortunately let himself in for much
more money than had the others and at a time when he could
least stand the strain.</p>

<p>The day De Malquit came to see Osterman, he was
behind his desk expecting many, and because, as I afterwards
learned from Mr. Osterman himself, Mr. De Malquit had
been so wary, making agreements at first, which made it
hard to trap him, Osterman saw him as one of those who
had made it most difficult for him to win, and therefore
deserving to be sheared the closest. “One hundred per
share, take it or leave it,” was his only comment in reply
to Mr. De Malquit’s statement that he found himself in a
bit of a hole and would like to explain how a little time
would see him through.</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Osterman,” I recall De Malquit replying,
“I haven’t so much now, and I can’t get it. These shares
were being quoted at seven and three-fourths only yesterday.
Can’t you let me off easier than that, or give me a few
months in which to pay? If I could have six months or a
year—I have some other matters that are pressing me even
more than this. They will have to come first, but I might
pull through if I had a little time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>“One hundred, on the nail. That’s the best I can do,”
Osterman replied, for I was in the room at the time. And
then signaled me to open the door for him.</p>

<p>But at that Mr. De Malquit turned and bent on him a
very troubled look, which, however, did not move Mr.
Osterman any. “Mr. Osterman,” he said, “I am not here
to waste either your time or mine. I am in a corner, and
I am desperate. Unless you can let me have some of this
stock at a reasonable price I am done for. That will bring
too much trouble to those who are near and dear to me for
me to care to live any longer. I am too old to begin over
again. Let me have some of it now. To-morrow will be
too late. Perhaps it won’t make any difference to you, but
I won’t be here to pay anybody. I have a wife who has
been an invalid for two years. I have a young son and
daughter in school. Unless I can go on—” He turned,
paused, swallowed, and then moistened his lips.</p>

<p>But Mr. Osterman was not inclined to believe any broker
or to be worked by sentiment. “Sorry. One hundred is
the best I can do.”</p>

<p>At that De Malquit struck his hands together, a resounding
smack, and then went out, turning upon Osterman
a last despairing glance. That same night De Malquit
killed himself, a thing which Osterman had assumed he
would not do—or so he said, and I resigned. The man
had really been in earnest. And, to make matters worse,
only three months later De Malquit’s wife killed herself,
taking poison in the small apartment to which she had been
forced to remove once the breadwinner of the family was
gone. According to the pictures and descriptions published
in the newspapers at the time she was, as De Malquit had
said, an invalid, practically bedridden. Also, according to
the newspapers, De Malquit had in more successful days
been charitably inclined, having contributed liberally to the
support of an orphan asylum, the Gratiot Home for Orphans,
the exterior appearance of which Osterman was
familiar with. This fact was published in all of the papers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
and was said to have impressed Osterman, who was said
always to have had a friendly leaning toward orphans. I
have since heard that only his very sudden death three years
ago prevented his signing a will which contained a proviso
leaving the bulk of his great fortune to a holding company
instructed to look after orphans. Whether this is truth or
romance I do not know.</p>

<p>2. The case of Henry Greasadick, another of Mr. Osterman’s
competitors, was similar. Mr. Greasadick has been
described to me as a very coarse and rough man, without
any education of any kind, but one who understood oil
prospecting and refining, and who was finally, though
rather unfortunately for himself, the cause of the development
by Osterman of the immensely valuable Arroya Verde
field. It is not likely that Greasadick would ever have
made the fortune from this field that Osterman and his
confrères were destined to reap. However, it is equally
true that he was most shabbily treated in the matter, far
more so than was De Malquit in regard to his very questionable
holdings and sales. The details of the Arroya Verde
field and Greasadick are as follows: Greasadick has been
described to me as a big, blustery, dusty soul, uncouth in
manners and speech, but one who was a sound and able
prospector. And Osterman, it appears, having laid the
foundation of his fortune by treating De Malquit and
others as he had, had come west, first to the lumber properties
of Washington and Oregon, where he bought immense
tracts; and later, to the oil lands of California and
Mexico, in which state and country he acquired very important
and eventually (under him) productive holdings.
Now it chanced that in his wanderings through southern
California and Arizona he came across Greasadick, who had
recently chanced upon a virgin oil field which, although
having very little capital himself, he was secretly attempting
to develop. In fact, Greasadick had no money when he
discovered this oil field and was borrowing from L. T.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
Drewberry, of the K. B. &amp; B., and one or two others on
the strength of his prospects. It also appears that Drewberry
it was who first called the attention of Osterman to
Greasadick and his find and later plotted with him to oust
Greasadick. Osterman was at that time one of three or
four men who were interested in developing the K. B. &amp; B.
into a paying property by extending it into Arizona.</p>

<p>At any rate, Greasadick’s holdings were one hundred
miles from any main line road, and there was very little
water, only a thin trickle that came down through a cut.
True, the K. B. &amp; B. was about to build a spur to Larston
in order to aid him, but Larston, once the line was built
to it, was fourteen miles away and left Greasadick with
the problem of piping or hauling his oil to that point. Once
he heard of it Osterman saw at a glance that by a little
deft manœuvring it could be made very difficult for Greasadick
to do anything with his property except sell, and this
manœuvring he proceeded to do. By buying the land above
Greasadick’s, which was a mountain slope, and then because
of a thin wall of clay and shale dividing the Arroya Verde,
in which lay Greasadick’s land, from the Arroya Blanco,
which was unwatered and worthless, being able to knock
the same through, he was able to divert the little water
upon which Greasadick then depended to do his work. Only
it was all disguised as a landslide—an act of God—and a
very expensive one for Greasadick to remedy. As for the
proposed spur to Larston—well, that was easy to delay indefinitely.
There was Drewberry, principal stockholder of
the K. B. &amp; B., who joined with Osterman in this adroit
scheme. Finally, there was the simple device of buying in the
mortgage given by Greasadick to Drewberry and others and
waiting until such time as he was hard-pressed to force
him to sell out. This was done through Whitley, Osterman’s
efficient assistant, who in turn employed another to
act for him. Throughout, Osterman saw to it that he
personally did not appear.</p>

<p>Of course Greasadick, when he discovered what the plot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
was, roared and charged like a bull. Indeed before he was
eventually defeated he became very threatening and dangerous,
attempting once even to kill Drewberry. Yet he was
finally vanquished and his holdings swept away. With no
money to make a new start and seeing others prosper where
he had failed for want of a little capital, he fell into a
heavy gloom and finally died there in Larston in the bar
that had been erected after the K. B. &amp; B. spur had been
completed. Through all of this Mr. Osterman appears to
have been utterly indifferent to the fate of the man he was
undermining. He cared so little what became of him afterwards
that he actually admitted, or remarked to Whitley,
who remained one of his slaves to the end, that one could
scarcely hope to build a large fortune without indulging in
a few such tricks.</p>

<p>3. Lastly, there was the matter of the C. C. and Q. L.
Railroad, the major portion of the stock of which he and
Frank O. Parm, of the Parm-Baggott chain of stores, had
managed to get hold of by the simple process of buying a
few shares and then bringing stockholders’ suits under one
and another name in order to embarrass President Doremus
and his directors, and frighten investors so they would let
go of the stock. And this stock, of course, was picked up
by Osterman and Parm, until at last these two became the
real power behind the road and caused it to be thrown into
the hands of a receiver and then sold to themselves. That
was two years before ever Michael Doremus, the first president
of the road, resigned. When he did he issued a statement
saying that he was being hounded by malign financial
influences and that the road was as sound as ever it had
been, which was true. Only it could not fight all of these
suits and the persistent rumors of mismanagement that were
afoot. As a matter of fact, Mr. Doremus died only a year
after resigning, declaring at that time that a just God ruled
and that time would justify himself. But Mr. Osterman
and Mr. Parm secured the road, and finally incorporated
it with the P. B. &amp; C. as is well known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span></p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>Some data taken from the biographic study of the late
J. H. Osterman, multimillionaire and oil king, prepared for
Lingley’s Magazine and by it published in its issue for
October, 1917.</p>

<p>In order to understand the late J. H. Osterman and his
great success and his peculiar faults one would first have to
have known and appreciated the hard and colorless life that
had surrounded him as a boy. His father, in so far as I
have been able to ascertain, was a crude, hard, narrow man
who had been made harder and, if anything, cruder by the
many things which he had been compelled to endure. He
was not a kind or soft-spoken man to his children. He died
when John Osterman, the central figure of this picture,
was eleven. Osterman’s mother, so it is said, was a thin
and narrow and conventional woman, as much harried and
put upon by her husband as ever he was by life. Also there
was one sister, unattractive and rough-featured, an honest
and narrow girl who, like her mother, worked hard up to
nineteen, when her mother died. After that, both parents
being dead, she and her brother attempted to manage the
farm, and did so fairly successfully for two years when the
sister decided to marry; and Osterman consenting, she took
over the farm. This falling in with his mood and plans,
he ceased farming for good and betook himself to the Texas
oil fields, where he appears to have mastered some of the
details of oil prospecting and refining.</p>

<p>But before that, what miseries had he not endured! He
was wont to recount how, when grasshoppers and drought
took all of their crops for two years after his father’s death,
he and his mother and sister were reduced to want and he
had actually been sent to beg a little cornmeal and salt
from the local store on the promise to pay, possibly a year
later. Taxes mounted up. There was no money to buy
seed or to plant or replace stock, which had had to be sold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
The family was without shoes or clothes. Osterman himself
appeared to be of the fixed opinion that the citizens
and dealers of Reamer, from near which point in Kansas
he hailed, were a hard and grasping crew. He was fond of
telling how swift they were to point out that there was
no help for either himself or his mother or sister as farmers
and to deny them aid and encouragement on that score. He
once said that all he ever heard in the local branch of his
mother’s church, of which he was never a confessing communicant,
was “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”; also
“with whatsoever measure ye mete it shall be measured to
you again.” Obviously such maxims taken very much to
heart by a boy of his acquisitive and determined nature might
bring about some of the shrewd financial tricks later accredited
to him. Yet he appears to have been a man of some
consideration and sympathy where boys were concerned, for
it was said that he made it a rule in all his adventures to
select the poorest if most determined youths of his organization
for promotion and to have developed all of his chief
lieutenants from the ranks of farm or orphan boy beginners
whom he encouraged to work for him. How true this is
the writer is not able to state. However, of the forty or
more eminent men who have been connected with him in
his enterprises, all but four were farm or orphan boys who
had entered his enterprises as clerks or menials at the very
bottom, and some seven of the total were from his native
State, Kansas.</p>

<p>The private cogitations of the late John H. Osterman
in his mansion at 1046 Fifth Avenue, New York, and elsewhere
during the last five years of his life.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Oh, but those days when he had been working and scheming
to get up in the world and was thinking that money<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
was the great thing—the only thing! Those impossible
wooden towns in the Northwest and elsewhere in which he
had lived and worked, and those worse hotels and boarding-houses—always
hunting, hunting for money or the key to
it. The greasy, stinking craft in which he had made his
way up weedy and muddy rivers in Honduras and elsewhere—looking
for what? Snakes, mosquitoes, alligators, tarantulas,
horned toads and lizards. In Honduras he had
slept under chiqua trees on mats of chiqua leaves, with only
a fire to keep away snakes and other things. And of a
morning he had chased away noisy monkeys and parroquets
from nearby branches with rotten fruit so as to sleep a little
longer. Alone, he had tramped through fever swamps, pursued
by Pequi Indians, who wanted only the contents of his
wretched pack. And he had stared at huge coyal palms, a
hundred feet high, with the great feathery leaves fifteen
feet long and their golden flowers three feet high. Ah, well,
that was over now. He had shot the quetzal with its
yellow tail feathers three feet long and had traded them
for food. Once he had all but died of fever in a halfbreed’s
hut back of Cayo. And the halfbreed had then
stolen his gun and razor and other goods and left him to
make his way onward as best he might. That was life for
you, just like that. People were like that.</p>

<p>And it was during that time that he had come to realize
that by no honest way at his age was he likely to come to
anything financially. Roaming about the drowsy, sun-baked
realm, he had encountered Messner, an American and a
fugitive, he guessed, and it was Messner who had outlined
to him the very scheme by which he had been able, later, to
amass his first quick fortune in New York. It was Messner
who had told him of Torbey and how he had come up to
London from Central Africa to offer shares in a bogus rubber
enterprise based on immense forests which he was supposed
to have found in the wilds of Africa yet which did not
exist. And it was the immense though inaccessible rubber
forests in Honduras that had inspired him to try the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
thing in New York. Why not? A new sucker was born
every minute, and he had all to gain and nothing to lose.
Messner said that Torbey had advertised for a widow with
some money to push his enterprise, whereupon he had proceeded
to tell the London speculative public of his treasure
and to sell two pound shares for as low as ten shillings in
order to show tremendous rises in value—to issue two
million pounds’ worth of absolutely worthless stock.</p>

<p>By these methods and by having the stock listed on the
London curb he was able to induce certain curb or “dog”
brokers to go short of this stock without having any of it
in their possession. Finally they began to sell so freely and
to pay so little attention to the amount that was being sold
that it was easy for Torbey to employ agents to buy from
all of them freely on margin. And then, as the law of the
curb and the state permitted, he had demanded (through
them, of course) the actual delivery of the shares, the full
curb value of the stock being offered. Of course the
brokers had none, although they had sold thousands; nor
had any one else except Torbey, who had seen to it that all
outstanding stock had been recalled to his safe. That meant
that they must come to Torbey to buy or face a jail sentence,
and accordingly they had flocked to his office, only to be
properly mulcted for the total face value of the shares when
they came.</p>

<p>Well, he had done that same thing in New York. Following
the example of the good Torbey, he had picked up
a few unimportant options in Honduras, far from any railroad,
and had come to New York to launch Calamita. Just
as Torbey had done, he had looked for a rich widow, a
piano manufacturer’s wife in this case, and had persuaded
her that there were millions in it. From her he had gone
on to Wall Street and the curb and had done almost exactly
as Torbey had done.... Only that fellow De Malquit
had killed himself, and that was not so pleasant. He hadn’t
anticipated that anything like that would happen! That
unfortunate wife of his. And those two children made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
orphans. That was the darkest spot. He hadn’t known,
of course, that De Malquit himself was helping orphans—or—And
from there he had gone on to the forests of
Washington and Oregon, where he had bought immense
tracts on which even yet he was realizing, more and more.
And from there it had been an easy step to oil in southern
California and Mexico—Ah, Greasadick, another sad
case!—And from there to mines and government concessions
in Peru and Ecuador, and the still greater ones in
Argentina and Chile. Money came fast to those who had
it. At last, having accumulated a fortune of at least nine
millions, he had been able to interest Nadia, and through
her the clever and well-to-do fashionable set who had backed
his projects with their free capital. And by now his fortune
had swollen to almost forty millions.</p>

<p>But what of it? Could he say he was really content?
What was he getting out of it? Life was so deceptive; it
used and then tossed one aside. At first it had seemed wonderful
to be able to go, do, act, buy and sell as he chose,
without considering anything save whether the thing he was
doing was agreeable and profitable. He had thought that
pleasure would never pall, but it had. There was this
thing about age, that it stole over one so unrelentingly,
fattening one up or thinning one down, hardening the
arteries and weakening the muscles and blood, until it was
all but useless to go on. And what was the import of his
success, anyhow, especially to one who had no children and
no friends worthy of the name? There was no such thing
as true friendship in nature. It was each man for himself,
everywhere, and the devil take the hindmost. It was life
that used and tossed one aside, however great or powerful
one might be. There was no staying life or the drift of
time.</p>

<p>Of course there had been the pleasure of building two
great houses for Nadia and living in them when he was not
living in other parts of the world. But all that had come
too late; he had been too old to enjoy them when they did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
come. She had been a great catch no doubt, but much too
attractive to be really interested in him at his age. His
wealth had been the point with her—any one could see that;
he knew it at the time and would not now try to deceive
himself as to that. At the time he had married her she had
had social position whereas he had none. And after she
married him all her social influence, to be sure, had been
used to advance his cause. Still, that scheme of hers to get
him to leave his great fortune to those two worthless sons
of hers. Never! They were not worthy of it. Those
dancing, loafing wasters! He would see to it that his fortune
was put to some better use than that. He would leave
it to orphans rather than to them, for after all orphans in
his employ had proved more valuable to him than even
they had, hadn’t they?—That curious fellow, De Malquit!—So
long ago. Besides wasn’t it Nadia’s two sons
who had influenced their mother to interest herself in
D’Eyraud, the architect who had built their two houses and
had started Nadia off on that gallery idea. And not a picture
in it that would interest a sensible person. And wasn’t it
because of her that he had never troubled to answer the
letters of his sister Elvira asking him to educate her two
boys for her. He had fancied at the time that taking her
two children into his life would in some way affect his
social relations with Nadia and her set. And now Elvira
was dead and he did not know where the children were.
He could charge that to her if he wanted to, couldn’t he?</p>

<p>Well, life was like that. When he had built his two
great houses he had thought they would prove an immense
satisfaction to him, as they had for a time; but he would not
be here much longer now to enjoy them. He wasn’t nearly
as active as he had been, and the sight of the large companies
of people that came to pose and say silly things to
each other was very wearying. They were always civil
to him, of course, but little more. They wanted the influence
of his name. And as long as he permitted it, his
homes would be haunted by those who wished to sell him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
things—stocks, bonds, enterprises, tapestries, estates, horses.
And those two boys of hers, along with Nadia herself where
her so-called art objects were concerned, so busy encouraging
them! Well, he was done with all that now. He would
not be bothered. Even youth and beauty of a venal character
had appeared on the scene and had attempted to set
traps for him. But his day was over. All these fripperies
and pleasures were for people younger than he. It required
youth and energy to see beauty and romance in such things,
and he hadn’t a trace of either left. His day was over and
he might as well die, really, for all the good he was, apart
from his money, to any one.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The reminiscences of Byington Briggs, Esq., of Skeff,
Briggs &amp; Waterhouse, private legal advisers to the late
J. H. Osterman, as developed in a private conversation at
the Metropolitan Club in New York in December, 19—.</p>
</div>

<p>“You knew old Osterman, didn’t you? I was his confidential
adviser for the last eight years of his life, and a
shrewder old hawk never sailed the air. He was a curious
combination of speculator, financier and dreamer, with a
high percentage of sharper thrown in for good measure.
You’d never imagine that he was charitably inclined, now
would you? It never occurred to me until about a year and
a half before his death. I have never been able to explain
it except that as a boy he had had a very hard time and in
his old age resented seeing his two stepsons, Kester and
Rand Benda, getting ready to make free use of his fortune
once he was gone. And then I think he had come to believe
that his wife was merely using him to feather her own nest.
I wouldn’t want it mentioned to a soul as coming from me,
but three months before he died he had me draw up a will
leaving his entire estate of something like forty millions,
not to her, as the earlier will filed by her showed, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
the J. H. Osterman Foundation, a corporation whose sole
purpose was to administer his fortune for the benefit of
something like three hundred thousand orphans incarcerated
in institutions in America. And but for the accident of his
sudden death out there at Shell Cove two years ago, he
would have left it that way.</p>

<p>“According to the terms of the will that I drew up, Mrs.
Osterman and her two sons were to receive only the interest
on certain bonds that were to be placed in trust for them
for their lifetime only; after that the money was to revert
to the fund. That would have netted them between forty
and fifty thousand a year among them—nothing more. In
the will I drew up he left $500,000 outright to that Gratiot
Home for Orphans up here at 68th Street, and he intended
his big country place at Shell Cove as the central unit in
a chain of modern local asylums for orphans that was to
have belted America. The income from the property managed
by the foundation was to have been devoted to this
work exclusively, and the Gratiot institution was to have
been the New York branch of the system. His wife has
leased the Shell Cove place to the Gerbermanns this year,
I see, and a wonderful place it is too, solid marble throughout,
a lake a mile long, a big sunken garden, a wonderful
glassed-in conservatory, and as fine a view of the sea as
you’ll find anywhere. Yet she never knew until the very
last hour of his life—the very last, for I was there—that
he planned to cut her off with only forty or fifty thousand
a year. If we weren’t all such close friends I wouldn’t
think of mentioning it even now, although I understand
that Klippert, who was his agent in the orphan project, has
been telling the story. It was this way:</p>

<p>“You see, I was his lawyer, and had been ever since the
K. B. &amp; B. control fight in 1906, and the old man liked me—I
don’t know why unless it was because I drew up the
right sort of ‘waterproof contracts,’ as he always called
them. Anyway, I knew six or seven years before he died
that he wasn’t getting along so well with Mrs. Osterman.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
She is still an attractive woman, with plenty of brain power
and taste, but I think he had concluded that she was using
him and that he wasn’t as happy as he thought he would
be. For one thing, as I gathered from one person and another,
she was much too devoted to those two boys by her
first husband, and in the next place I think he felt that she
was letting that architect D’Eyraud lead her about too
much and spend too much of his money. You know it was
common rumor at the time that D’Eyraud and his friend
Beseroe, another man the old captain disliked, were behind
her in all her selections of pictures for the gallery she was
bringing together up there in the Fifth Avenue place. Osterman,
of course, knowing absolutely nothing about art, was
completely out of it. He wouldn’t have known a fine painting
from a good lithograph, and I don’t think he cared very
much either. And yet it was a painting that was one of
the causes of some feeling between them, as I will show
you. At that time he looked mighty lonely and forlorn to
me, as though he didn’t have a friend in the world outside
of those business associates and employés of his. He stayed
principally in that big town house, and Mrs. Benda—I mean
Mrs. Osterman—and her sons and their friends found a
good many excuses for staying out at Shell Cove. There
were always big doings out there. Still, she was clever
enough to be around him sometimes so as to make it appear,
to him at least, that she wasn’t neglecting him. As for him,
he just pottered around up there in that great house, showing
his agents and employés, and the fellows who buzzed
about him to sell him things, the pictures she was collecting—or,
rather, D’Eyraud—and letting it appear that he was
having something to do with it. For he was a vain old
soldier, even if he did have one of the best business minds of
his time. You’d think largeness of vision in some things
might break a man of that, but it never does, apparently.</p>

<p>“Whenever I think of him I think of that big house,
those heavily carved and gilded rooms, the enormous eighty-thousand
dollar organ built into the reception-room, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
those tall stained-glass windows that gave the place the air
of a church. Beseroe once told me that if left to follow
her own taste Mrs. Osterman would never have built that
type of house, but that Osterman wanted something grand
and had got his idea of grandeur from churches. So there
was nothing to do but build him a house with tall Gothic
windows and a pipe-organ, and trust to other features to
make it homelike and livable. But before they were through
with it Mrs. Osterman and D’Eyraud had decided that the
best that could be done with it would be to build something
that later could be turned into an art gallery and either
sold or left as a memorial. But I think both D’Eyraud and
Mrs. Osterman were kidding the old man a little when they
had that self-playing attachment built in. It looked to me
as though they thought he was going to be alone a good
part of the time and might as well have something to amuse
himself with. And he did amuse himself with it, too. I
recall going up there one day and finding him alone, in so
far as the family was concerned, but entirely surrounded by
twenty-five or more of those hard, slick and yet nervous
(where social form was concerned) western and southern
business agents and managers of his, present there to hold a
conference. A luncheon was about to be served in the grand
dining-room adjoining the reception-room, and there were
all these fellows sitting about that big room like a lot of
blackbirds, and Osterman upon a raised dais at one end of
the room solemnly rendering <em>The Bluebells of Scotland</em>, one
of his favorites, from the self-player attachment! And
when he finished they all applauded!</p>

<p>“Well, what I wanted to tell you is this: One day while
I was there, some dealer dropped in with a small picture
which for some reason took his fancy. According to Beseroe,
it wasn’t such a bad thing, painted by a Swedish realist by
the name of Dargson. It showed a rather worn-out woman
of about forty-three who had committed suicide and was
lying on a bed, one hand stretched out over the edge and a
glass or bottle from which she had taken the poison lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
on the floor beside her. Two young children and a man
were standing near, commiserating themselves on their loss,
I presume. It seemed to have a tremendous impression on
Osterman for some reason or other. I could never understand
why—it was not so much art as a comment on human
suffering. Nevertheless, Osterman wanted it, but I think
he wanted Nadia to buy it for her collection and so justify
his opinion of it. But Nadia, according to Beseroe, was
interested only in certain pictures as illustrations of the
different schools and periods of art in different countries.
And when the dealer approached her with the thing, at
Osterman’s suggestion, it was immediately rejected by her.
At once Osterman bought it for himself, and to show that
he was not very much concerned about her opinion he hung
it in his bedroom. Thereafter he began to be quarrelsome
in regard to the worthwhileness of the gallery idea as a
whole and to object to so much money being squandered in
that direction. But to this day no one seems to know just
why he liked that particular picture so much.</p>

<p>“What I personally know is that it was just about this
time that Osterman began to be interested in that fellow
Klippert and his plan for improving the condition of the
orphan. He finally turned him over to me with the request
that I go into the idea thoroughly, not only in regard to the
work done by the Gratiot Home but by orphan asylums in
general in America. He told us that he wanted it all kept
very quiet until he was ready to act, that if anything was
said he would refuse to have anything further to do with
it. That was a part of his plan to outwit Mrs. Osterman,
of course. He told us that he wanted some scheme in connection
with orphans that would be new and progressive,
better than anything now being done, something that would
do away with great barracks and crowd regulations and
cheap ugly uniforms and would introduce a system of education
and home life in cottages. I had no idea then that
he was planning the immense thing that was really in his
mind, and neither did Klippert. He thought he might be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
intending to furnish enough money to revive the Gratiot
Home as an experiment, and he urged me to use my influence
to this end if I had any. As it turned out, he wanted
to establish an interstate affair, as wide as the nation, of
which the place at Shell Cove was to be the centre or head—a
kind of Eastern watering-place or resort for orphans
from all over America. It was a colossal idea and would
have taken all of his money and more.</p>

<p>“But since he wanted it I went into the idea thoroughly
with this fellow Klippert. He was very clever, that man,
honest and thorough and business-like and disinterested, in
so far as I could see. I liked him, and so did Osterman,
only Osterman wanted him to keep out of sight of his wife
until he was ready to act. Klippert made a regular business
of his problem and went all over the United States studying
institutions of the kind. Finally he came back with figures
on about fifty or sixty and a plan which was the same as that
outlined to me by Osterman and which I incorporated in his
will, and there it ended for the time being. He didn’t want
to sign it right away for some reason, and there it lay in
my safe until—well, let me tell you how it was.</p>

<p>One Saturday morning—it was a beautiful day and I was
thinking of going out to the club to play golf—I received a
long distance call from Osterman asking me to get hold of
Klippert and another fellow by the name of Moss and
bring them out to Shell Cove, along with the will for him
to sign. He had made up his mind, he said, and I have
often wondered if he had a premonition of what was going
to happen.</p>

<p>“I remember so well how excited Klippert was when I
got him on the wire. He was just like a boy, that fellow,
in his enthusiasm for the scheme, and apparently not interested
in anything except the welfare of those orphans.
We started for Shell Cove, and what do you think? Just
as we got there—I remember it all as though it had happened
yesterday. It was a bright, hot Saturday afternoon.
There were some big doings on the grounds, white-and-green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
and white-and-red striped marque tents, and chairs and
swings and tables everywhere. Some of the smartest people
were there, sitting or walking or dancing on the balcony.
And there was Osterman walking up and down the south
verandah near the main motor entrance, waiting for us, I
suppose. As we drove up he recognized us, for he waved
his hand, and then just as we were getting out and he was
walking towards us, I saw him reel and go down. It was
just as though some one had struck him with something.
I realized that it must be paralysis or a stroke of apoplexy
and I chilled all over at the thought of what it might mean.
Klippert went up the steps four at a time, and as we all
ran down the verandah they carried him in and I telephoned
for a doctor. Klippert was very still and white. All we
could do was to stand around and wait and look at each
other, for Mrs. Osterman and her sons were there and
were taking charge. Finally word came out that Mr.
Osterman was a little better and wanted to see us, so up
we went. He had been carried into an airy, sunny room
overlooking the sea and was lying in a big white canopied
bed looking as pale and weak as he would if he had been ill
for a month. He could scarcely speak and lay there and
looked at us for a time, his mouth open and a kind of tremor
passing over his lips from time to time. Then he seemed to
gather a little strength and whispered: ‘I want—I want—’
and then he stopped and rested, unable to go on. The
doctor arrived and gave him a little whisky, and then he
began again, trying so hard to speak and not quite making
it. At last he whispered: ‘I want—I want—that—that—paper.’
And then: ‘Klippert—and you—’ He stopped
again, then added: ‘Get all these others out of here—all
but you three and the doctor.’</p>

<p>“The doctor urged Mrs. Osterman and her sons to leave,
but I could see that she didn’t like it. Even after she went
out she kept returning on one excuse and another, and she
was there when he died. When she was out of the room the
first time I produced the will and he nodded his approval.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
We called for a writing board, and they brought one—a
Ouija board, by the way. We lifted him up, but he was
too weak and fell back. When we finally got him up and
spread the will before him he tried to grasp the pen but
he couldn’t close his fingers. He shook his head and half
whispered: The——the——boys—th—the—boys.’ Klippert
was all excited, but Osterman could do nothing. Then
his wife came into the room and asked: ‘What is it that you
are trying to make poor Johnnie sign? Don’t you think you
had better let it rest until he is stronger?’ She tried to
pick up the paper but I was too quick for her and lifted
it to one side as though I hadn’t noticed that she had reached
for it. I could see that she was aware that something was
being done that neither we nor Osterman wanted her to
know about, and her eyes fairly snapped. Osterman must
have realized that things were becoming a little shaky for
he kept looking at first one and then another of us with a
most unhappy look. He motioned for the pen and will.
Klippert put down the board and I the paper, and he leaned
forward and tried to grasp the pen. When he found he
couldn’t he actually groaned: ‘The—the—I—I—I want
to—to—do something—for—for—the—the—the—’ Then
he fell back, and the next moment was dead.</p>

<p>“But I wish you could have seen Klippert. It wasn’t
anything he said or did, but just something that passed over
his face, the shadow of a great cause or idea dying, let us
say. Something seemed to go out from or die in him, just as
old Osterman had died. He turned and went out without a
word. I would have gone too, only Mrs. Osterman intercepted
me.</p>

<p>“You might think that at such a moment she would have
been too wrought up to think of anything but her husband’s
death, but she wasn’t. Far from it. Instead, as her husband
was lying there, and right before the doctor, she came over
to me and demanded to see the paper. I was folding it up
to put into my pocket when she flicked it out of my hands.
‘I am sure you can have no objection to my seeing this,’ she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
said icily, and when I protested she added: ‘I am sure that
I have a right to see my own husband’s will.’ I had only
been attempting to spare her feelings, but when I saw what
her attitude was I let it go at that and let her read it.</p>

<p>“I wish you could have seen her face! Her eyes narrowed
and she bent over the paper as though she were about
to eat it. When she fully comprehended what it was all
about she fairly gasped and shook—with rage, I think—though
fear as to what might have happened except for her
husband’s weakness may have been a part of it. She looked
at him, at his dead body, the only glance he got from her
that day, I’m sure, then at me, and left the room. Since
there was nothing more to do, I went too.</p>

<p>“And that’s the reason Mrs. Osterman has never been
friends with me since, though she was genial enough before.
But it was a close shave for her, all the same, and don’t you
think it wasn’t. Just an ounce or two more of strength in
that old codger’s system, and think what would have been
done with those millions. She wouldn’t have got even a
million of it all told. And those little ragamuffins would
have had it all. How’s that for a stroke of chance?”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">What</span> had given him his first hint that all might
not be as well at home as he imagined was the
incident of the automobile. Up to that time he had
not had a troubled thought about her, not one. But
after—Well, it was a year and a half now and
although suspicion still lingered it was becoming weaker.
But it had not been obliterated even though he could not
help being fond of Beryl, especially since they had Tickles
to look after between them. But anyhow, in spite of all his
dark thoughts and subtle efforts to put two and two together,
he had not been able to make anything of it. Perhaps
he was being unjust to her to go on brooding about
it.... But how was it possible that so many suspicious-looking
things could happen in a given time, and one never
be able to get the straight of them?</p>

<p>The main thing that had hampered him was his work.
He was connected with the Tri-State Paper Company, at
the City Order desk, and as a faithful employé he was
not supposed to leave during working hours without permission,
and it was not always easy to get permission. It
was easy to count the times he had been off—once to go
to the dentist, and two or three times to go home when
Beryl was ill. Yet it just happened that on that particular
afternoon his superior, Mr. Baggott, had suggested that
he, in the place of Naigly who always attended to such
matters but was away at the time, should run out to the
Detts-Scanlon store and ask Mr. Pierce just what was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
wrong with that last order that had been shipped. There
was a mix-up somewhere, and it had been impossible to
get the thing straight over the telephone.</p>

<p>Well, just as he was returning to the office, seated in one
of those comfortable cross seats of the Davenant Avenue
line and looking at the jumble of traffic out near Blakely
Avenue, and just as the car was nearing the entrance to
Briscoe Park he saw a tan-and-chocolate-colored automobile
driven by a biggish man in a light tan overcoat and cap
swing into view, cross in front of the car, and enter the
park. It was all over in a flash. But just as the car swung
near him who should he see sitting beside the man but
Beryl, or certainly a woman who was enough like her to be
her twin sister. He would have sworn it was Beryl. And
what was more, and worse, she was smiling up at this man
as though they were on the best of terms and had known
each other a long time! Of course he had only had a
glimpse, and might have been mistaken. Beryl had told
him that morning that she was going to spend the afternoon
with her mother. She often did that, sometimes leaving
Tickles there while she did her mother’s marketing. Or,
she and her mother, or she and her sister Alice, if she
chanced to be there, would take the baby for a walk in the
park. Of course he might have been mistaken.</p>

<p>But that hat with the bunch of bright green grapes on
the side.... And that green-and-white striped coat....
And that peculiar way in which she always held her head
when she was talking. Was it really Beryl? If it wasn’t,
why should he have had such a keen conviction that it was?</p>

<p>Up to that time there never had been anything of a
doubtful character between them—that is, nothing except
that business of the Raskoffsky picture, which didn’t amount
to much in itself. Anybody might become interested in a
great violinist and write him for his photo, though even
that couldn’t be <em>proved</em> against Beryl. It was inscribed to
Alice. But even if she had written him, that wasn’t a patch
compared to this last, her driving about in a car with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
strange man. Certainly that would justify him in any
steps that he chose to take, even to getting a divorce.</p>

<p>But what had he been able to prove so far? Nothing.
He had tried to find her that afternoon, first at their own
house, then at her mother’s, and then at Winton &amp; Marko’s
real estate office, where Alice sometimes helped out, but he
couldn’t find a trace of her. Still, did that prove anything
once and for all? She might have been to the concert as
she said, she and Alice. It must be dull to stay in the house
all day long, anyhow, and he couldn’t blame her for doing
the few things she did within their means. Often he tried
to get in touch with her of a morning or afternoon, and
there was no answer, seeing that she was over to her mother’s
or out to market, as she said. And up to the afternoon of
the automobile it had never occurred to him that there was
anything queer about it. When he called up Beryl’s
mother she had said that Beryl and Alice had gone to a
concert and it wasn’t believable that Mrs. Dana would
lie to him about anything. Maybe the two of them were
doing something they shouldn’t, or maybe Alice was helping
Beryl to do something she shouldn’t, without their mother
knowing anything about it. Alice was like that, sly. It
was quite certain that if there had been any correspondence
between Beryl and that man Raskoffsky, that time he had
found the picture inscribed to Alice, it had been Alice
who had been the go-between. Alice had probably allowed
her name and address to be used for Beryl’s pleasure—that
is, if there was anything to it at all. It wasn’t likely
that Beryl would have attempted anything like that without
Alice’s help.</p>

<p>But just the same he had never been able to prove that
they had been in league, at that time or any other. If there
was anything in it they were too clever to let him catch them.
The day he thought he had seen her in the car he had first
tried to get her by telephone and then had gone to the office,
since it was on his way, to get permission to go home for a
few minutes. But what had he gained by it? By the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
he got there, Beryl and her mother were already there, having
just walked over from Mrs. Dana’s home, according to
Beryl. And Beryl was not wearing the hat and coat he had
seen in the car, and that was what he wanted to find out.
But between the time he had called up her mother and the
time he had managed to get home she had had time enough
to return and change her clothes and go over to her mother’s
if there was any reason why she should. That was what
had troubled him and caused him to doubt ever since. She
would have known by then that he had been trying to get
her on the telephone and would have had any answer ready
for him. And that may have been exactly what happened,
assuming that she had been in the car and gotten home
ahead of him, and presuming her mother had lied for her,
which she would not do—not Mrs. Dana. For when he
had walked in, a little flushed and excited, Beryl had exclaimed:
“Whatever is the matter, Gil?” And then:
“What a crazy thing, to come hurrying home just to ask
me about this! Of course I haven’t been in any car. How
ridiculous! Ask Mother. You wouldn’t expect her to fib
for me, would you?” And then to clinch the matter she had
added: “Alice and I left Tickles with her and went to
the concert after going into the park for a while. When
we returned, Alice stopped home so Mother could walk
over here with me. What are you so excited about.” And
for the life of him, he had not been able to say anything
except that he had seen a woman going into Briscoe Park
in a tan-and-chocolate car, seated beside a big man who
looked like—well, he couldn’t say exactly whom he did
look like. But the woman beside him certainly looked like
Beryl. And she had had on a hat with green grapes on
one side and a white-and-green striped sports coat, just like
the one she had. Taking all that into consideration, what
would any one think? But she had laughed it off, and
what was he to say? He certainly couldn’t accuse Mrs.
Dana of not knowing what she was talking about, or Beryl
of lying, unless he was sure of what he was saying. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
was too strong-minded and too strong-willed for that. She
had only married him after a long period of begging on
his part; and she wasn’t any too anxious to live with him
now unless they could get along comfortably together.</p>

<p>Yet taken along with that Raskoffsky business of only a
few months before, and the incident of the Hotel Deming
of only the day before (but of which he had thought nothing
until he had seen her in the car), and the incident of
the letters in the ashes, which followed on the morning
after he had dashed home that day, and then that business
of the closed car in Bergley Place, just three nights afterwards—well,
by George! when one put such things
together—</p>

<p>It was very hard to put these things in the order of their
effect on him, though it was easy to put them in their actual
order as to time. The Hotel Deming incident had occurred
only the day before the automobile affair and taken alone,
meant nothing, just a chance encounter with her on the
part of Naigly, who had chosen to speak of it. But joined
afterwards with the business of the partly burned letters
and after seeing her in that car or thinking he had—Well—After
that, naturally his mind had gone back to
that Hotel Deming business, and to the car, too. Naigly,
who had been interested in Beryl before her marriage (she
had been Baggott’s stenographer), came into the office
about four—the day before he had seen Beryl, or thought
he had, in the car, and had said to him casually: “I saw
your wife just now, Stoddard.” “That so? Where?”
“She was coming out of the Deming ladies’ entrance as I
passed just now.” Well, taken by itself, there was nothing
much in that, was there? There was an arcade of shops
which made the main entrance to the Deming, and it was
easy to go through that and come out of one of the other
entrances. He knew Beryl had done it before, so why
should he have worried about it then? Only, for some
reason, when he came home that evening Beryl didn’t mention
that she had been downtown that day until he asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span>
her. “What were you doing about four to-day?” “Downtown,
shopping. Why? Did you see me? I went for
Mother.” “Me? No. Who do you know in the Deming?”
“No one”—this without a trace of self-consciousness, which
was one of the things that made him doubt whether there
had been anything wrong. “Oh, yes; I remember now. I
walked through to look at the hats in Anna McCarty’s window,
and came out the ladies’ entrance. Why?” “Oh,
nothing. Naigly said he saw you, that’s all. You’re getting
to be a regular gadabout these days.” “Oh, what nonsense!
Why shouldn’t I go through the Deming Arcade? I would
have stopped in to see you, only I know you don’t like me
to come bothering around there.”</p>

<p>And so he had dismissed it from his mind—until the incident
of the car.</p>

<p>And then the matter of the letters ... and Raskoffsky ...</p>

<p>Beryl was crazy about music, although she couldn’t play
except a little by ear. Her mother had been too poor to
give her anything more than a common school education,
which was about all that he had had. But she was crazy
about the violin and anybody who could play it, and when
any of the great violinists came to town she always managed
to afford to go. Raskoffsky was a big blond Russian
who played wonderfully, so she said. She and Alice had
gone to hear him, and for weeks afterward they had raved
about him. They had even talked of writing to him, just
to see if he would answer, but he had frowned on such a
proceeding because he didn’t want Beryl writing to any man.
What good would it do her? A man like that wouldn’t
bother about answering her letter, especially if all the
women were as crazy about him as the papers said. Yet
later he had found Raskoffsky’s picture in Beryl’s room, only
it was inscribed to Alice.... Still, Beryl might have put
Alice up to it, might even have sent her own picture under
Alice’s name, just to see if he would answer. They had
talked of sending a picture. Besides, if Alice had written<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
and secured this picture, why wasn’t it in her rather than
Beryl’s possession. He had asked about that. Yet the one
flaw in that was that Alice wasn’t really good-looking enough
to send her picture and she knew it. Yet Beryl had sworn
that she hadn’t written. And Alice had insisted that it was
she and not Beryl who had written. But there was no way
of proving that she hadn’t or that Beryl had.</p>

<p>Yet why all the secrecy? Neither of them had said anything
more about writing Raskoffsky after that first time.
And it was only because he had come across Raskoffsky’s
picture in one of Beryl’s books that he had come to know
anything about it at all. “To my fair little western admirer
who likes my ‘Dance Macabre’ so much. The next
time I play in your city you must come and see me.” But
Alice wasn’t fair or good-looking. Beryl was. And it was
Beryl and not Alice, who had first raved over that dance;
Alice didn’t care so much for music. And wasn’t it Beryl,
and not Alice, who had proposed writing him. Yet it was
Alice who had received the answer. How was that? Very
likely it was Beryl who had persuaded Alice to write for
her, sending her own instead of Alice’s picture, and getting
Alice to receive Raskoffsky’s picture for her when it came.
Something in their manner the day he had found the picture
indicated as much. Alice had been so quick to say: “Oh yes.
I wrote him.” But Beryl had looked a little queer when she
caught him looking at her, had even flushed slightly,
although she had kept her indifferent manner. At that time
the incident of the car hadn’t occurred. But afterwards,—after
he had imagined he had seen Beryl in the car—it had
occurred to him that maybe it was Raskoffsky with whom
she was with that day. He was playing in Columbus, so the
papers said, and he might have been passing through the city.
He was a large man too, as he now recalled, by George! If
only he could find a way to prove that!</p>

<p>Still, even so and when you come right down to it, was
there anything so terrible about her writing a celebrity like
that and asking for his picture, if that was all she had done.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
But was it? Those long-enveloped gray letters he had
found in the fireplace that morning, after that day in which
he had seen her in the car (or thought he had)—or at least
traces of them. And the queer way she had looked at him
when he brought them up in connection with that closed car
in Bergley Place. She had squinted her eyes as if to think,
and had then laughed rather shakily when he charged her
with receiving letters from Raskoffsky, and with his having
come here to see her. His finding them had been entirely by
accident. He always got up early to “start things,” for
Beryl was a sleepyhead, and he would start the fire in the
grate and put on the water to boil in the kitchen. And this
morning as he was bending over the grate to push away some
scraps of burnt wood so as to start a new fire, he came
across five or six letters, or the ashes of them, all close together
as though they might have been tied with a ribbon or
something. What was left of them looked as though they
had been written on heavy stationery such as a man of means
might use, the envelopes long and thick. The top one still
showed the address—“Mrs. Beryl Stoddard, Care of ——”
He was bending over to see the rest when a piece of wood
toppled over and destroyed it. He rescued one little scrap,
the half-charred corner of one page, and the writing on this
seemed to be like that on Raskoffsky’s picture, or so he
thought, and he read: “to see you.” Just that and nothing
more, part of a sentence that ended the page and went to the
next. And that page was gone, of course!</p>

<p>But it was funny wasn’t it, that at sight of them the
thought of Raskoffsky should have come to him? And that
ride in the park. Come to think of it, the man in the car
had looked a little like Raskoffsky’s picture. And for all he
knew, Raskoffsky might have then been in town—returned
for this especial purpose,—and she might have been meeting
him on the sly. Of course. At the Deming. That was it.
He had never been quite able to believe her. All the circumstances
at the time pointed to something of the kind,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
even if he had never been able to tie them together and
make her confess to the truth of them.</p>

<p>But how he had suffered after that because of that thought!
Things had seemed to go black before him. Beryl unfaithful?
Beryl running around with a man like that, even if he
was a great violinist? Everybody knew what kind of a man
he was—all those men. The papers were always saying how
crazy women were over him, and yet that he should come all
the way to C—— to make trouble between him and Beryl!
(If only he could prove that!) But why should she, with
himself and Tickles to look after, and a life of her own
which was all right—why should she be wanting to run
around with a man like that, a man who would use her
for a little while and then drop her. And when she had
a home of her own? And her baby? And her mother and
sister right here in C——? And him? And working
as hard as he was and trying to make things come out right
for them? That was the worst of it. That was the misery
of it. And all for a little notice from a man who was so
far above her or thought he was, anyhow, that he couldn’t
care for her or any one long. The papers had said so at
the time. But that was the whole secret. She was so crazy
about people who did anything in music or painting or
anything like that, that she couldn’t reason right about
them. And she might have done a thing like that on that
account. Personally he wouldn’t give a snap of his finger
for the whole outfit. They weren’t ordinary, decent people
anyhow. But making herself as common as that! And
right here in C——, too, where they were both known.
Oh, if only he had been able to prove that! If only he
had been able to at that time!</p>

<p>When he had recovered himself a little that morning
after he had found the traces of the letters in the ashes he
had wanted to go into the bedroom where she was still
asleep and drag her out by the hair and beat her and make
her confess to these things. Yes, he had. There had been
all but murder in his heart that morning. He would show<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
her. She couldn’t get away with any such raw stuff as
that even if she did have her mother and sister to help her.
(That sly little Alice, always putting her sister up to something
and never liking him from the first, anyhow.) But
then the thought had come to him that after all he might be
wrong. Supposing the letters weren’t from Raskoffsky?
And supposing she had told the truth when she said she
hadn’t been in the car? He had nothing to go on except
what he imagined, and up to then everything had been as
wonderful as could be between them. Still....</p>

<p>Then another thought had come: if the letters weren’t
from Raskoffsky who were they from? He didn’t know of
anybody who would be writing her on any such paper as
that. And if not Raskoffsky whom did she know? And
why should she throw them in the fire, choosing a time when
he wasn’t about? That was strange, especially after the
automobile incident of the day before. But when he taxed
her with this the night of the Bergley Place car incident—she
had denied everything and said they were from Claire
Haggerty, an old chum who had moved to New York just
about the time they were married and who had been writing
her at her mother’s because at that time he and she didn’t
have a home of their own and that was the only address she
could give. She had been meaning to destroy them but had
been putting it off. But only the night before she had come
across them in a drawer and had tossed them in the fire, and
that was all there was to that.</p>

<p>But was that all there was to it?</p>

<p>For even as he had been standing there in front of the
grate wondering what to do the thought had come to him
that he was not going about this in the right way. He had
had the thought that he should hire a detective at once
and have her shadowed and then if she were doing anything,
it might be possible to find it out. That would have
been better. That was really the way. Yet instead of
doing that he had gone on quarreling with her, had burst
in on her with everything that he suspected or saw, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
thought he saw, and that it was, if anything, that had given
her warning each time and had allowed her to get the
upper hand of him, if she had got the upper hand of him.
That was it. Yet he had gone on and quarreled with her
that day just the same, only, after he had thought it all over,
he had decided to consult the Sol Cohn Detective Service and
have her watched. But that very night, coming back from
the night conference with Mr. Harris Cohn, which was the
only time he could get to give it, was the night he had seen
the car in Bergley Place, and Beryl near it.</p>

<p>Bergley Place was a cross street two doors from where
they lived on Winton. And just around the corner in
Bergley, was an old vacant residence with a deal of shrubbery
and four overarching trees in front, which made it
very dark there at night. That night as he was coming
home from Mr. Harris Cohn’s—(he had told Beryl that he
was going to the lodge, in order to throw her off and had
come home earlier in order to see what he might see) and
just as he was stepping off the Nutley Avenue car which
turned into Marko Street, about half a block above where
they lived whom should he see—But, no, let us put it this
way. Just at that moment or a moment later as he turned
toward his home an automobile that had been going the same
way he was along Winton swung into Bergley Place
and threw its exceptionally brilliant lights on a big closed
automobile that was standing in front of the old house aforementioned.
There were two vacant corner lots opposite the
old house at Bergley and Winton and hence it was that he
could see what was going on. Near the rear of the automobile,
just as though she had stepped out of it and was about
to leave, stood Beryl—or, he certainly thought it was Beryl,
talking to some one in the car, just as one would before parting
and returning into the house. She had on a hooded
cape exactly like the one she wore at times though not often.
She did not like hooded capes any more. They were out of
style. Just the same so sure had he been that it was Beryl
and that at last he had trapped her that he hurried on to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
house or, rather, toward the car. But just as he neared the
corner the lights of the car that had been standing there
lightless flashed on for a second—then off and then sped
away. Yet even with them on there had not been enough
light to see whether it was Beryl, or who. Or what the
number on the license plate was. It was gone and with it
Beryl, presumably up the alley way and into the back door
or so he had believed. So sure was he that she had gone that
way that he himself had gone that way. Yet when he
reached the rear door following her, as he chose to do, it was
locked and the kitchen was dark. And he had to rap and
pound even before she came to let him in. And when she
did there she was looking as though she had not been out at
all, undressed, ready for bed and wanting to know why he
chose to come that way! And asking him not to make so
much noise for fear of waking Tickles...!</p>

<p>Think of it. Not a trace of excitement. No cape with
a hood on. The light up in the dining-room and a book
on the table as though she might have been reading—one
of those novels by that fellow Barclay. And not a sign
about anywhere that she might have been out—that was
the puzzling thing. And denying that she had been out
or that she had seen any car, or anything. Now what would
you make of that!</p>

<p>Then it was, though, that he had burst forth in a fury of
suspicion and anger and had dealt not only with this matter
of the car in Bergley Place but the one in Briscoe Park, the
letters in the ashes and the matter of Naigly seeing her
come out of the Deming, to say nothing of her writing to
Raskoffsky for his picture. For it was Raskoffsky, of course,
if it was anybody. He was as positive as to that as any one
could be. Who else could it have been? He had not even
hesitated to insist that he knew who it was—Raskoffsky,
of course—and that he had seen him and had been able
to recognize him from his pictures. Yet she had denied that
vehemently—even laughingly—or that he had seen any one,
or that there had been a car there for her. And she did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
show him a clipping a week later which said that Raskoffsky
was in Italy.</p>

<p>But if it wasn’t Raskoffsky then who was it—if it was
any one. “For goodness’ sake, Gil,” was all she would say
at that or any other time, “I haven’t been out with Raskoffsky
or any one and I don’t think you ought to come in here
and act as you do. It seems to me you must be losing your
mind. I haven’t seen or heard of any old car. Do you
think I could stand here and say that I hadn’t if I had?
And I don’t like the way you have of rushing in here of
late every little while and accusing me of something that I
haven’t done. What grounds have you for thinking that I
have done anything wrong anyhow? That silly picture of
Raskoffsky that Alice sent for. And that you think you saw
me in an automobile. Not another thing. If you don’t
stop now and let me alone I will leave you I tell you
and that is all there is to it. I won’t be annoyed in this
way and especially when you have nothing to go on.” It
was with that type of counter-argument that she had confronted
him.</p>

<p>Besides, at that time—the night that he thought he
saw her in Bergley Place—and as if to emphasize what she
was saying, Tickles in the bedroom had waked up and begun
to call “Mama, Mama.” And she had gone in to him
and brought him out even as she talked. And she had
seemed very serious and defiant, then—very much more
like her natural self and like a person who had been injured
and was at bay. So he had become downright doubtful,
again, and had gone back into the dining-room. And there
was the light up and the book that she had been reading.
And in the closet as he had seen when he had hung up his
own coat was her hooded cape on the nail at the back where
it always hung.</p>

<p>And yet how could he have been mistaken as to all of
those things? Surely there must have been something to
some of them. He could never quite feel, even now, that
there hadn’t been. Yet outside of just that brief period in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
which all of these things had occurred there had never been
a thing that he could put his hands on, nothing that he
could say looked even suspicious before or since. And the
detective agency had not been able to find out anything
about her either—not a thing. That had been money wasted:
one hundred dollars. Now how was that?</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>The trouble with Gil was that he was so very suspicious
by nature and not very clever. He was really a clerk, with
a clerk’s mind and a clerk’s point of view. He would never
rise to bigger things, because he couldn’t, and yet she could
not utterly dislike him either. He was always so very much
in love with her, so generous—to her, at least—and he did
the best he could to support her and Tickles which was
something, of course. A lot of the trouble was that he was
too affectionate and too clinging. He was always hanging
around whenever he was not working. And with never a
thought of going any place without her except to his lodge
or on a business errand that he couldn’t possibly escape.
And if he did go he was always in such haste to get back!
Before she had ever thought of marrying him, when he
was shipping clerk at the Tri-State and she was Mr.
Baggott’s stenographer, she had seen that he was not very
remarkable as a man. He hadn’t the air or the force of
Mr. Baggott, for whom she worked then and whose assistant
Gil later became. Indeed, Mr. Baggott had once said:
“Gilbert is all right, energetic and faithful enough, but he
lacks a large grasp of things.” And yet in spite of all that
she had married him.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Well, it was hard to say. He was not bad-looking, rather
handsome, in fact, and that had meant a lot to her then.
He had fine, large black eyes and a pale forehead and pink
cheeks, and such nice clean hands. And he always dressed so
well for a young man in his position. He was so faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
and yearning, a very dog at her heels. But she shouldn’t
have married him, just the same. It was all a mistake.
He was not the man for her. She knew that now. And,
really, she had known it then, only she had not allowed
her common sense to act. She was always too sentimental
then—not practical enough as she was now. It was only
after she was married and surrounded by the various problems
that marriage includes that she had begun to wake up.
But then it was too late.</p>

<p>Yes, she had married, and by the end of the first year and
a half, during which the original glamour had had time
to subside, she had Tickles, or Gilbert, Jr., to look after.
And with him had come a new mood such as she had never
dreamed of in connection with herself. Just as her interest
in Gil had begun to wane a little her interest in Tickles
had sprung into flame. And for all of three years now it
had grown stronger rather than weaker. She fairly adored
her boy and wouldn’t think of doing anything to harm him.
And yet she grew so weary at times of the humdrum life
they were compelled to live. Gil only made forty-five dollars
a week, even now. And on that they had to clothe and
feed and house the three of them. It was no easy matter.
She would rather go out and work. But it was not so easy
with a three-year-old baby. And besides Gil would never
hear of such a thing. He was just one of those young
husbands who thought the wife’s place was in the home,
even when he couldn’t provide a very good home for her to
live in.</p>

<p>Still, during these last few years she had had a chance
to read and think, two things which up to that time she
had never seemed to have time for. Before that it had
always been beaux and other girls. But most of the girls
were married now and so there was an end to them. But
reading and thinking had gradually taken up all of her spare
time, and that had brought about such a change in her. She
really wasn’t the same girl now that Gil had married at all.
She was wiser. And she knew so much more about life now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
than he did. And she thought so much more, and so differently.
He was still at about the place mentally that he had
been when she married him, interested in making a better
place for himself in the Tri-State office and in playing golf
or tennis out at the country club whenever he could afford
the time to go out there. And he expected her to curry
favor with Dr. and Mrs. Realk, and Mr. and Mrs. Stofft,
because they had a car and because Mr. Stofft and Gil liked
to play cards together. But beyond that he thought of nothing,
not a thing.</p>

<p>But during all of this time she had more and more realized
that Gil would never make anything much of himself.
Alice had cautioned her against him before ever they had
married. He was not a business man in any true sense.
He couldn’t think of a single thing at which he could make
any money except in the paper business, and that required
more capital than ever he would have. Everybody else
they knew was prospering. And perhaps it was that realization
that had thrown her back upon books and pictures and
that sort of thing. People who did things in those days
were so much more interesting than people who just made
money, anyhow.</p>

<p>Yet she would never have entered upon that dangerous
affair with Mr. Barclay if it hadn’t been for the awful
mental doldrums she found herself in about the time
Tickles was two years old and Gil was so worried as to
whether he would be able to keep his place at the Tri-State
any longer. He had put all the money they had
been able to save into that building and loan scheme, and
when that had failed they were certainly up against it for
a time. There was just nothing to do with, and there was
no prospect of relief. To this day she had no clothes to
speak of. And there wasn’t much promise of getting them
now. And she wasn’t getting any younger. Still, there was
Tickles, and she was brushing up on her shorthand again.
If the worst came—</p>

<p>But she wouldn’t have entered upon that adventure that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
had come so near to ending disastrously for herself and
Tickles—for certainly if Gil had ever found out he could
have taken Tickles away from her—if it hadn’t been for
that book <em>Heyday</em> which Mr. Barclay wrote and which she
came across just when she was feeling so out of sorts with
life and Gil and everything. That had pictured her own
life so keenly and truly; indeed, it seemed to set her own
life before her just as it was and as though some one were
telling her about herself. It was the story of a girl somewhat
like herself who had dreamed her way through a
rather pinched girlhood, having to work for a living from
the age of fourteen. And then just as she was able to make
her own way had made a foolish marriage with a man of
no import in any way—a clerk, just like Gil. And he had
led her through more years of meagre living, until at last,
very tired of it all, she had been about to yield herself to
another man who didn’t care very much about her but who
had money and could do the things for her that her husband
couldn’t. Then of a sudden in this story her husband chose
to disappear and leave her to make her way as best she might.
The one difference between that story and her own life was
that there was no little Tickles to look after. And Gil would
never disappear, of course. But the heroine of the story
had returned to her work without compromising herself.
And in the course of time had met an architect who had the
good sense or the romance to fall in love with and marry
her. And so the story, which was so much like hers, except
for Tickles and the architect, had ended happily.</p>

<p>But hers—well—</p>

<p>But the chances she had taken at that time! The restless
and yet dreamy mood in which she had been and moved and
which eventually had prompted her to write Mr. Barclay,
feeling very doubtful as to whether he would be interested in
her and yet drawn to him because of the life he had pictured.
Her thought had been that if he could take enough interest
in a girl like the one in the book to describe her so truly he
might be a little interested in her real life. Only her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
thought at first had been not to entice him; she had not believed
that she could. Rather, it was more the feeling
that if he would he might be of some help to her, since
he had written so sympathetically of Lila, the heroine.
She was faced by the problem of what to do with her life,
as Lila had been, but at that she hadn’t expected him to
solve it for her—merely to advise her.</p>

<p>But afterwards, when he had written to thank her, she
feared that she might not hear from him again and had
thought of that picture of herself, the one Dr. Realk had
taken of her laughing so heartily, the one that everybody
liked so much. She had felt that that might entice him to
further correspondence with her, since his letters were so
different and interesting, and she had sent it and asked him
if his heroine looked anything like her, just as an excuse for
sending it. Then had come that kindly letter in which he
had explained his point of view and advised her, unless
she were very unhappy, to do nothing until she should be
able to look after herself in the great world. Life was an
economic problem. As for himself, he was too much the
rover to be more than a passing word to any one. His
work came first. Apart from that, he said he drifted up and
down the world trying to make the best of a life that tended
to bore him. However if ever he came that way he would
be glad to look her up and advise her as best he might, but
that she must not let him compromise her in any way. It
was not advisable in her very difficult position.</p>

<p>Even then she had not been able to give him up, so interested
had she been by all he had written. And besides,
he had eventually come to U—— only a hundred and fifty
miles away, and had written from there to know if he might
come over to see her. She couldn’t do other than invite him,
although she had known at the time that it was a dangerous
thing to do. There was no solution, and it had only caused
trouble—and how much trouble! And yet in the face of
her mood then, anything had been welcome as a relief. She
had been feeling that unless something happened to break<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
the monotony she would do something desperate. And then
something did happen. He had come, and there was nothing
but trouble, and very much trouble, until he had gone
again.</p>

<p>You would have thought there was some secret unseen
force attending her and Gil at that time and leading him
to wherever she was at just the time she didn’t want him to
be there. Take for example, that matter of Gil finding Mr.
Barclay’s letters in the fire after she had taken such care to
throw them on the live coals behind some burning wood.
He had evidently been able to make out a part of the address,
anyhow, for he had said they were addressed to her in
care of somebody he couldn’t make out. And yet he was all
wrong, as to the writer, of course. He had the crazy notion,
based on his having found that picture of Raskoffsky inscribed
to Alice, some months before, that they must be from
him, just because he thought she had used Alice to write and
ask Raskoffsky for his picture—which she had. But that
was before she had ever read any of Mr. Barclay’s books.
Yet if it hadn’t been for Gil’s crazy notion that it was
Raskoffsky she was interested in she wouldn’t have had the
courage to face it out the way she had, the danger of losing
Tickles, which had come to her the moment Gil had proved
so suspicious and watchful, frightening her so. Those three
terrible days! And imagine him finding those bits of letters
in the ashes and making something out of them! The uncanniness
of it all.</p>

<p>And then that time he saw her speeding through the gate
into Briscoe Park. They couldn’t have been more than a
second passing there, anyhow, and yet he had been able to
pick her out! Worse, Mr. Barclay hadn’t even intended
coming back that way; they had just made the mistake of
turning down Ridgely instead of Warren. Yet, of course,
Gil had to be there, of all places, when as a rule he was
never out of the office at any time. Fortunately for her
she was on her way home, so there was no chance of his
getting there ahead of her as, plainly, he planned afterwards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
Still, if it hadn’t been for her mother whom everybody believed,
and who actually believed that she and Alice had
been to the concert, she would never have had the courage
to face him. She hadn’t expected him home in the first
place, but when he did come and she realized that unless she
faced him out then and there in front of her mother who
believed in her, that <em>she</em> as well as he would know, there was
but one thing to do—brave it. Fortunately her mother
hadn’t seen her in that coat and hat which Gil insisted that
she had on. For before going she and Alice had taken
Tickles over to her mother’s and then she had returned and
changed her dress. And before Gil had arrived Alice had
gone on home and told her mother to bring over the baby,
which was the thing that had so confused Gil really. For
he didn’t know about the change and neither did her mother.
And her mother did not believe that there had been any,
which made her think that Gil was a little crazy, talking
that way. And her mother didn’t know to this day—she
was so unsuspecting.</p>

<p>And then that terrible night on which he thought he had
seen her in Bergley Place and came in to catch her. Would
she ever forget that? Or that evening, two days before,
when he had come home and said that Naigly had seen her
coming out of the Deming. She could tell by his manner
that time that he thought nothing of that then—he was so
used to her going downtown in the daytime anyhow. But
that Naigly should have seen her just then when of all times
she would rather he would not have!</p>

<p>To be sure it had been a risky thing—going there to meet
Mr. Barclay in that way, only from another point of view
it had not seemed so. Every one went through the Deming
Arcade for one reason or another and that made any one’s
being seen there rather meaningless. And in the great
crowd that was always there it was the commonest thing for
any one to meet any one else and stop and talk for a moment
anyhow. That was all she was there for that day—to see
Mr. Barclay on his arrival and make an appointment for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
the next day. She had done it because she knew she couldn’t
stay long and she knew Gil wouldn’t be out at that time
and that if any one else saw her she could say that it was
almost any one they knew casually between them. Gil was
like that, rather easy at times. But to think that Naigly
should have been passing the Deming just as she was coming
out—alone, fortunately—and should have run and told Gil.
That was like him. It was pure malice. He had never
liked her since she had turned him down for Gil. And he
would like to make trouble for her if he could, that was all.
That was the way people did who were disappointed in love.</p>

<p>But the worst and the most curious thing of all was that
last evening in Bergley Place, the last time she ever saw
Mr. Barclay anywhere. That <em>was</em> odd. She had known by
then, of course, that Gil was suspicious and might be watching
her and she hadn’t intended to give him any further
excuse for complaint. But that was his lodge night and he
had never missed a meeting since they had been married—not
one. Besides she had only intended to stay out about an
hour and always within range of the house so that if Gil
got off the car or any one else came she would know of it.
She had not even turned out the light in the dining-room,
intending to say if Gil came back unexpectedly or any one
else called, that she had just run around the corner in the
next block to see Mrs. Stofft. And in order that that statement
might not be questioned, she had gone over there for
just a little while before Mr. Barclay was due to arrive with
his car. She had even asked Mr. Barclay to wait in the
shadow of the old Dalrymple house in Bergley Place, under
the trees, in order that the car might not be seen. So few
people went up that street, anyhow. And it was always
so dark in there. Besides it was near to raining which made
it seem safer still. And yet he had seen her. And just as
she was about to leave. And when she had concluded that
everything had turned out so well.</p>

<p>But how could she have foreseen that a big car with such
powerful lights as that would have turned in there just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
then. Or that Gil would step off the car and look up that
way? Or that he would be coming home an hour earlier
when he never did—not from lodge meeting. And besides
she hadn’t intended to go out that evening at all until Mr.
Barclay called up and said he must leave the next day, for
a few days anyhow, and wanted to see her before he went.
She had thought that if they stayed somewhere in the neighborhood
in a closed car, as he suggested, it would be all
right. But, no. That big car had to turn in there just
when it did, and Gil had to be getting off the car and looking
up Bergley Place just when it did, and she had to be standing
there saying good-bye, just as the lights flashed on that
spot. Some people might be lucky, but certainly she was
not one of them. The only thing that had saved her was
the fact that she had been able to get in the house ahead of
Gil, hang up her cape and go in to her room and undress and
see if Tickles was still asleep. And yet when he did burst
in she had felt that she could not face him—he was so desperate
and angry. And yet, good luck, it had ended in his
doubting whether he had really seen her or not, though even
to this day he would never admit that he doubted.</p>

<p>But the real reason why she hadn’t seen Mr. Barclay
since (and that in the face of the fact that he had been
here in the city once since, and that, as he wrote, he had
taken such a fancy to her and wanted to see her and help
her in any way she chose), was not that she was afraid of
Gil or that she liked him more than she did Mr. Barclay
(they were too different in all their thoughts and ways for
that) or that she would have to give up her life here and
do something else, if Gil really should have found out (she
wouldn’t have minded that at all)—but because only the
day before Mr. Barclay’s last letter she had found out that
under the law Gil would have the power to take Tickles
away from her and not let her see him any more if he
caught her in any wrongdoing. That was the thing that
had frightened her more than anything else could have and
had decided her, then and there, that whatever it was she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</span>
was thinking she might want to do, it could never repay
her for the pain and agony that the loss of Tickles would
bring her. She had not really stopped to think of that
before. Besides on the night of that quarrel with Gil, that
night he thought he saw her in Bergley Place and he had
sworn that if ever he could prove anything he would take
Tickles away from her, or, that he would kill her and
Tickles and himself and Raskoffsky (Raskoffsky!), it
was then really that she had realized that she couldn’t do
without Tickles—no, not for a time even. Her dream of
a happier life would be nothing without him—she knew
that. And so it was that she had fought there as she had
to make Gil believe he was mistaken, even in the face of
the fact that he actually knew he had seen her. It was
the danger of the loss of Tickles that had given her the
courage and humor and calmness, the thought of what the
loss of him would mean, the feeling that life would be
colorless and blank unless she could take him with her wherever
she went, whenever that might be, if ever it was.</p>

<p>And so when Gil had burst in as he did she had taken up
Tickles and faced him, after Gil’s loud talk had waked him.
And Tickles had put his arms about her neck and called
“Mama! Mama!” even while she was wondering how she
was ever to get out of that scrape. And then because he
had fallen asleep again, lying close to her neck, even while
Gil was quarreling, she had told herself then that if she
came through that quarrel safely she would never do anything
more to jeopardize her claim to Tickles, come what
might. And with that resolution she had been able to talk
to Gil so convincingly and defiantly that he had finally
begun to doubt his own senses, as she could see. And so it
was that she had managed to face him out and to win
completely.</p>

<p>And then the very next day she had called up Mr. Barclay
and told him that she couldn’t go on with that affair,
and why—that Tickles meant too much to her, that she
would have to wait and see how her life would work out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</span>
And he had been so nice about it then and had sympathized
with her and had told her that, all things considered, he
believed she was acting wisely and for her own happiness.
And so she had been. Only since he had written her and
she had had to say no to him again. And now he had gone
for good. And she admired him so much. And she had never
heard from him since, for she had asked him not to write
to her unless she first wrote to him.</p>

<p>But with how much regret she had done that! And how
commonplace and humdrum this world looked at times now,
even with the possession of Tickles. Those few wonderful
days.... And that dream that had mounted so high.
Yet she had Tickles. And in the novel the husband had
gone away and the architect had appeared.</p>

THE “MERCY” OF GOD</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Once, one of his disciples, walking with him in the garden,
said: ‘Master, how may I know the Infinite, the Good, and attain
to union with it, as thou hast?’ And he replied: ‘By desiring it
utterly, with all thy heart and with all thy mind.’ And the disciple
replied: ‘But that I do.’ ‘Nay, not utterly,’ replied the
Master, ‘or thou wouldst not now ask how thou mayst attain to
union with it. But come with me,’ he added, ‘and I will show
thee.’ And he led the way to a stream, and into the water, and
there, by reason of his greater strength, he seized upon his disciple
and immersed him completely, so that presently he could not
breathe but must have suffocated and drowned had it not been
his plan to bring him forth whole. Only when, by reason of this,
the strength of the disciple began to wane and he would have
drowned, the Master drew him forth and stretched him upon the
bank and restored him. And when he was sufficiently restored
and seeing that he was not dead but whole, he exclaimed: ‘But,
Master, why didst thou submerge me in the stream and hold me
there until I was like to die?’ And the Master replied: ‘Didst
thou not say that above all things thou desirest union with the
Infinite?’ ‘Yea, true; but in life, not death.’ ‘That I know,’
answered the Master. ‘But now tell me: When thou wast thus
held in the water what was it that thou didst most desire?’ ‘To
be restored to breath, to life.’ ‘And how much didst thou desire
it?’ ‘As thou sawest—with all my strength and with all my
mind.’ ‘Verily. Then when in life thou desirest union with the
All-Good, the Infinite, as passionately as thou didst life in the
water, it will come. Thou wilt know it then, and not before.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A friend</span> of mine, a quite celebrated neurologist,
psychiatrist, and interpreter of Freud, and myself
were met one night to discuss a very much talked-of book
of his, a book of clinical studies relative to various obsessions,
perversions and inhibitions which had afflicted various
people in their day and which he, as a specialist in these
matters, had investigated and attempted to alleviate. To
begin with, I should say that he had filled many difficult and
responsible positions in hospitals, asylums, and later, as a
professor of these matters, occupied a chair in one of our
principal universities. He was kindly, thoughtful, and intensely
curious as to the workings of this formula we call
life, but without lending himself to any—at least to very
few—hard and fast dogmas. More interesting still life
appeared to interest but never to discourage him. He really
liked it. Pain, he said, he accepted as an incentive, an urge
to life. Strife he liked because it hardened all to strength.
And he believed in action as the antidote to too much
thought, the way out of brooding and sorrow. Youth
passes, strength passes, life forms pass; but action makes
all bearable and even enjoyable. Also he wanted more
labor, not less, more toil, more exertion, for humanity. And
he insisted that through, not round or outside, life lay the
way to happiness, if there was a way. But with action all
the while. So much for his personal point of view.</p>

<p>On the other hand he was always saying of me that I
had a touch of the Hindu in me, the Far East, the Brahmin.
I emphasized too much indifference to life—or, if not that,
I quarreled too much with pain, unhappiness, and did not
impress strongly enough the need of action. I was forever
saying that the strain was too great, that there had best
be less of action, less of pain.... As to the need of less
pain, I agreed, but never to the need of less action; in verification
of which I pointed to my own life, the changes I had
deliberately courted, the various activities I had entered
upon, the results I had sought for. He was not to be routed
from his contention entirely, nor I from mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span></p>

<p>Following this personal analysis we fell to discussing a
third man, whom we both admired, an eminent physiologist,
then connected with one of the great experimental laboratories
of the world, who had made many deductions and discoveries
in connection with the associative faculty of the
brain and the mechanics of associative memory. This man
was a mechanist, not an evolutionist, and of the most convinced
type. To him nowhere in nature was there any
serene and directive and thoughtful conception which
brought about, and was still bringing about continually, all
the marvels of structure and form and movement that so
arrest and startle our intelligence at every turn. Nowhere
any constructive or commanding force which had thought
out, for instance, and brought to pass flowers, trees, animals,
men—associative order and community life. On the contrary,
the beauty of nature as well as the order of all living,
such as it is, was an accident, and not even a necessary one,
yet unescapable, a condition or link in an accidental chain.
If you would believe him and his experiments, the greatest
human beings that ever lived and the most perfect states of
society that ever were have no more significance in nature
than the most minute ephemera. The Macedonian Alexander
is as much at the mercy of fate as the lowest infusoria.
For every germ that shoots up into a tree thousands are
either killed or stunted by unfavorable conditions; and although,
beyond question, many of them—the most—bear
within themselves the same power as the successful ones to
be and to do, had they the opportunity, still they fail—a
belief of my own in part, albeit a hard doctrine.</p>

<p>One would have thought, as I said to Professor Z——
at this meeting, that such a mental conviction would be
dulling and destructive to initiative and force, and I asked
him why he thought it had not operated to blunt and destroy
this very great man. “For the very reasons I am always
emphasizing,” he replied. “Pain, necessity, life stung him
into action and profound thought, hence success. He is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
person he is by reason of enforced mental and physical
action.”</p>

<p>“But,” I argued, “his philosophy makes him account it
all as worthless, or, if not that, so fleeting and unstable as
to make it scarcely worth the doing, even though he does
it. As he sees it, happiness and tribulation, glory and obscurity,
are all an accident. Science, industry, politics, like
races and planets, are accidents. Trivial conditions cause
great characters and geniuses like himself to rest or to remain
inactive, and mediocre ones are occasionally permitted
to execute great deeds or frustrate them in the absence of
the chance that might have produced a master. Circumstances
are stronger than personalities, and the impotence of
individuals is the tragedy of everyday life.”</p>

<p>“Quite so,” agreed my friend, “and there are times when
I am inclined to agree with him, but at most times not.
I used to keep hanging in one of my offices, printed and
framed, that famous quotation from Ecclesiastes: ‘I returned,
and saw under the sun that the race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
wise, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance
happeneth to them all.’ But I took it down because it was
too discouraging. And yet,” he added after a time, because
we both fell silent at this point, “although I still think it is
true, as time has gone on and I have experimented with life
and with people I have come to believe that there is something
else in nature, some not as yet understood impulse,
which seeks to arrange and right and balance things at
times. I know that this sounds unduly optimistic and vainly
cheerful, especially from me, and many—you, for one, will
disagree—but I have sometimes encountered things in my
work which have caused me to feel that nature isn’t altogether
hard or cruel or careless, even though accidents appear
to happen.”</p>

<p>“Accidents?” I said; “holocausts, you mean.” But he
continued:</p>

<p>“Of course, I do not believe in absolute good or absolute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
evil, although I do believe in relative good and relative
evil. Take tenderness and pity, in some of their results at
least. Our friend Z——, on the contrary, sees all as accident,
or blind chance and without much if any real or
effective pity or amelioration, a state that I cannot reason
myself into. Quite adversely, I think there is something
that helps life along or out of its difficulties. I know that
you will not agree with me; still, I believe it, and while I
do not think there is any direct and immediate response,
such as the Christian Scientists and the New Thought
devotees would have us believe, I know there is a response
at times, or at least I think there is, and I think I can prove
it. Take dreams, for instance, which, as Freud has demonstrated,
are nature’s way of permitting a man to sleep in the
presence of some mental worry that would tend to keep him
awake, or if he had fallen asleep, and stood in danger to
wake him.”</p>

<p>I waived that as a point, but then he referred to medicine
and surgery and all the mechanical developments as well as
the ameliorative efforts of life, such as laws relating to child
labor, workingmen’s compensation and hours, compulsory
safety devices and the like, as specific proofs of a desire on
the part of nature, working through man, to make life
easier for man, a wish on her part to provide him, slowly
and stumblingly, mayhap, with things helpful to him in
his condition here. Without interrupting him, I allowed
him to call to mind the Protestant Reformation, how it had
ended once and for all the iniquities of the Inquisition; the
rise of Christianity, and how, temporarily at least, it had
modified if not entirely ended the brutalities of Paganism.
Anesthetics, and how they had served to ameliorate pain.
I could have pointed out that life itself was living on life
and always had been, and that as yet no substitute for the
flesh of helpless animals had been furnished man as food.
(He could not hear my thoughts.) The automobile, he
went on, had already practically eliminated the long sufferings
of the horse; our anti-slavery rebellion and humane<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
opposition in other countries had once and for all put an
end to human slavery; also he called to mind the growth
of humane societies of one kind and another, that ministered
to many tortured animals. And humane laws were being
constantly passed and enforced to better if not entirely cure
inhuman conditions.</p>

<p>I confess I was interested, if not convinced. In spite of
life itself existing on life, there was too much in what he
said to permit any one to pass over it indifferently. But
there came to my mind just the same all the many instances
of crass accident and brutish mischance which are neither
prevented nor cured by anything—the thousands who are
annually killed in railroad accidents and industrial plants,
despite protective mechanisms and fortifying laws compelling
their use; the thousands who die yearly from epidemics
of influenza, smallpox, yellow fever, cholera and widespread
dissemination of cancer, consumption and related ills.
These I mentioned. He admitted the force of the point
but insisted that man, impelled by nature, not only for his
own immediate protection but by reason of a sympathy
aroused through pain endured by him, was moved to kindly
action. Besides if nature loved brutality and inhumanity
and suffering why should any atom of it wish to escape pain,
and why in those atoms should it generate sympathy and
tears and rejoicing at escape from suffering by man, why
sorrow and horror at the accidental or intentional infliction
of disaster on man by nature or man?</p>

<p>After a time, he volunteered: “Let me give you a concrete
instance. It has always interested me and it seems to
prove that there is something to what I say. It concerns a
girl I know, a very homely one, who lost her mind. At
the beginning of her mental trouble her father called me in
to see what, if anything, could be done. The parents of this
girl were Catholics. He was a successful contractor and
politician, the father of three children; he provided very
well for them materially but could do little for them mentally.
He was not the intellectual but the religious type.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
The mother was a cheerful, good-natured and conventional
woman, and had only the welfare of her children and her
husband at heart. When I first came to know this family—I
was a young medical man then—this girl was thirteen or
fourteen, the youngest of the three children. Of these three
children, and for that matter of the entire family, I saw that
this girl was decidedly the most interesting psychically and
emotionally. She was intense and receptive, but inclined to
be morbid; and for a very good reason. She was not good-looking,
not in any way attractive physically. Worse, she
had too good a mind, too keen a perception, not to know
how severe a deprivation that was likely to prove and to
resent it. As I came to know through later investigations—all
the little neglects and petty deprivations which, owing to
her lack of looks and the exceeding and of course superior
charms of her sister and brother, were throughout her infancy
and youth thrust upon her. Her mouth was not sweet—too
large; her eyes unsatisfactory as to setting, not as to
wistfulness; her nose and chin were unfortunately large,
and above her left eye was a birthmark, a livid scar as large
as a penny. In addition her complexion was sallow and
muddy, and she was not possessed of a truly graceful figure;
far from it. After she had reached fifteen or sixteen, she
walked, entirely by reason of mental depression, I am sure,
with a slow and sagging and moody gait; something within,
I suppose, always whispering to her that hope was useless,
that there was no good in trying, that she had been mercilessly
and irretrievably handicapped to begin with.</p>

<p>“On the other hand, as chance would have it, her sister
and brother had been almost especially favored by nature.
Celeste Ryan was bright, vivacious, colorful. She was possessed
of a graceful body, a beautiful face, clear, large and
blue eyes, light glossy hair, and a love for life. She could
sing and dance. She was sought after and courted by all
sorts of men and boys. I myself, as a young man, used to
wish that I could interest her in myself, and often went to
the house on her account. Her brother also was smart, well-favored,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
careful as to his clothes, vain, and interested in and
fascinating to girls of a certain degree of mind. He and
his sister liked to dance, to attend parties, to play and disport
themselves wherever young people were gathered.</p>

<p>“And for the greater part of Marguerite’s youth, or
until her sister and brother were married, this house was
a centre for all the casual and playful goings-on of youth.
Girls and boys, all interested in Celeste and her brother,
came and went—girls to see the good-looking brother, boys
to flirt with and dance attendance upon the really charming
Celeste. In winter there was skating; in summer automobiling,
trips to the beach, camping even. In most of
these affairs, so long as it was humanly possible, the favorless
sister was included; but, as we all know, especially where
thoughtless and aggressive youth is concerned, such little
courtesies are not always humanly possible. Youth will be
served. In the main it is too intent upon the sorting and
mating process, each for himself, to give the slightest heed
or care for another. Væ Victis.</p>

<p>“To make matters worse, and possibly because her several
deficiencies early acquainted her with the fact that all boys
and girls found her sister and brother so much more attractive,
Marguerite grew reticent and recessive—so much
so that when I first saw her she was already slipping about
with the air of one who appeared to feel that she was not
as ingratiating and acceptable as she might be, even though,
as I saw, her mother and father sought to make her feel
that she was. Her father, a stodgy and silent man, too
involved in the absurdities of politics and religion and the
difficulties of his position to give very much attention to
the intricacies and subtleties of his children’s personalities,
never did guess the real pain that was Marguerite’s. He
was a narrow and determined religionist, one who saw in
religious abstention, a guarded and reserved life, the only
keys to peace and salvation. In fact before he died an altar
was built in his house and mass was read there for his
especial spiritual benefit every morning. What he thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
of the gayeties of his two eldest children at this time I do
not know, but since these were harmless and in both cases
led to happy and enduring marriages, he had nothing to
quarrel with. As for his youngest child, I doubt if he ever
sensed in any way the moods and torturous broodings that
were hers, the horrors that attend the disappointed love life.
He had not been disappointed in his love life, and was therefore
not able to understand. He was not sensitive enough
to have suffered greatly if he had been, I am sure. But his
wife, a soft, pliable, affectionate, gracious woman, early
sensed that her daughter must pay heavily for her looks,
and in consequence sought in every way to woo her into
an unruffled complacence with life and herself.</p>

<p>“But how little the arts of man can do toward making
up for the niggardliness of nature! I am certain that always,
from her earliest years, this ugly girl loved her considerate
mother and was grateful to her; but she was a girl
of insight, if not hard practical sense or fortitude, and loved
life too much to be content with the love of her mother
only. She realized all too keenly the crass, if accidental,
injustice which had been done her by nature and was unhappy,
terribly so. To be sure, she tried to interest herself
in books, the theatre, going about with a homely girl or two
like herself. But before her ever must have been the spectacle
of the happiness of others, their dreams and their
fulfilments. Indeed, for the greater part of these years,
and for several years after, until both her sister and brother
had married and gone away, she was very much alone, and,
as I reasoned it out afterwards, imagining and dreaming
about all the things she would like to be and do. But without
any power to compel them. Finally she took to reading
persistently, to attending theatres, lectures and what not—to
establish some contact, I presume, with the gay life
scenes she saw about her. But I fancy that these were not
of much help, for life may not be lived by proxy. And
besides, her father, if not her mother, resented a too liberal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
thought life. He believed that his faith and its teachings
were the only proper solution to life.</p>

<p>“One of the things that interested me in connection with
this case—and this I gathered as chief medical counsel of
the family between Marguerite’s fifteenth and twenty-fifth
year—was that because of the lack of beauty that so tortured
her in her youth she had come to take refuge in
books, and then, because of these, the facts which they revealed
in regard to a mere worthwhile life than she could
have, to draw away from all religion as worthless, or at
least not very important as a relief from pain. And yet
there must have been many things in these books which tortured
her quite as much as reality, for she selected, as her
father once told me afterward—not her mother, who could
read little or nothing—only such books as she should not
read; books, I presume, that painted life as she wished it to
be for herself. They were by Anatole France, George
Moore, de Maupassant and Dostoyevsky. Also she went
to plays her father disapproved of and brooded in libraries.
And she followed, as she herself explained to me, one lecturer
and another, one personality and another, more, I
am sure, because by this method she hoped to contact, although
she never seemed to, men who were interesting to
her, than because she was interested in the things they themselves
set forth.</p>

<p>“In connection with all this I can tell you of only one
love incident which befell her. Somewhere around the time
when she was twenty-one or -two she came in contact with
a young teacher, himself not very attractive or promising
and whose prospects, as her father saw them, were not very
much. But since she was not pretty and rather lonely and
he seemed to find companionship, and mayhap solace in her,
no great objection was made to him. In fact as time went
on, and she and the teacher became more and more intimate,
both she and her parents assumed that in the course of time
they would most certainly marry. For instance, at the end
of his school-teaching year here in New York, and although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
he left the city he kept up a long correspondence with her.
In addition, he spent at least some of his vacation near New
York, at times returning and going about with her and
seeming to feel that she was of some value to him in some
way.</p>

<p>“How much of this was due to the fact that she was
provided with spending money of her own and could take
him here and there, to places to which he could not possibly
have afforded to go alone I cannot say. None the less, it was
assumed, because of their companionship and the fact that
she would have some money of her own after marriage, that
he would propose. But he did not. Instead, he came year
after year, visited about with her, took up her time, as the
family saw it (her worthless time!), and then departed for
his duties elsewhere as free as when he had come. Finally
this having irritated if not infuriated the several members
of her family, they took her to task about it, saying that she
was a fool for trifling with him. But she, although perhaps
depressed by all this, was still not willing to give him up;
he was her one hope. Her explanation to the family was
that because he was poor he was too proud to marry until
he had established himself. Thus several more years came
and went, and he returned or wrote, but still he did not
propose. And then of a sudden he stopped writing entirely
for a time, and still later on wrote that he had fallen in
love and was about to be married.</p>

<p>“This blow appeared to be the crowning one in her life.
For in the face of the opposition, and to a certain degree
contempt, of her father, who was a practical and fairly
successful man, she had devoted herself to this man who was
neither successful nor very attractive for almost seven years.
And then after so long a period, in which apparently he
had used her to make life a little easier for himself, even
he had walked away and left her for another. She fell to
brooding more and more to herself, reading not so much
now, as I personally know, as just thinking. She walked a
great deal, as her father told me, and then later began to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
interest herself, or so she pretended, in a course of history
and philosophy at one of the great universities of the city.
But as suddenly, thereafter, she appeared to swing between
exaggerated periods of study or play or lecture-listening and
a form of recessive despair, under the influence of which she
retired to her room and stayed there for days, wishing
neither to see nor hear from any one—not even to eat. On
the other hand again, she turned abruptly to shopping, dressmaking
and the niceties which concerned her personal appearance;
although even in this latter phase there were times
when she did nothing at all, seemed to relax toward her old
listlessness and sense of inconsequence and remained in her
room to brood.</p>

<p>“About this time, as I was told afterwards, her mother
died and, her sister and brother having married, she was
left in charge of the house and of her father. It was soon
evident that she had no particular qualifications for or interest
in housekeeping, and a maiden sister of her father
came to look after things. This did not necessarily darken
the scene, but it did not seem to lighten it any. She liked
this aunt well enough, although they had very little in common
mentally. Marguerite went on as before. Parallel
with all this, however, had run certain things which I have
forgotten to mention. Her father had been growing more
and more narrowly religious. As a matter of fact he had
never had any sympathy for the shrewd mental development
toward which her lack of beauty had driven her. Before she
was twenty-three as I have already explained, her father
had noted that she was indifferent to her church duties. She
had to be urged to go to mass on Sunday, to confession and
communion once a month. Also as he told me afterward, as
something to be deplored, her reading had caused her to believe
that her faith was by no means infallible, its ritual
important; there were bigger and more interesting things in
life. This had caused her father not only to mistrust but to
detest the character of her reading, as well as her tendencies
in general. From having some sympathy with her at first,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
as did her mother always, as the ugly duckling of the family,
he had come to have a cold and stand-offish feeling. She was,
as he saw it, an unnatural child. She did not obey him in
respect to religion. He began, as I have hinted, to look into
her books, those in the English tongue at least, and from a
casual inspection came to feel that they were not fit books
for any one to read. They were irreligious, immoral. They
pictured life as it actually was, scenes and needs and gayeties
and conflicts, which, whether they existed or not, were not
supposed to exist; and most certainly they were not to be
introduced into his home, her own starved disposition to the
contrary notwithstanding. They conflicted with the natural
chill and peace of his religion and temperament. He forbade
her to read such stuff, to bring such books into his home.
When he found some of them later he burned them. He also
began to urge the claims of his religion more and more upon
her.</p>

<p>“Reduced by this calamity and her financial dependence,
which had always remained complete, she hid her books
away and read them only outside or in the privacy of her
locked room—but she read them. The subsequent discovery
by him that she was still doing this, and his rage, caused her
to think of leaving home. But she was without training,
without any place to go, really. If she should go she would
have to prepare herself for it by teaching, perhaps, and this
she now decided to take up.</p>

<p>“About this time she began to develop those characteristics
or aberrations which brought me into the case. As
I have said, she began to manifest a most exaggerated and
extraordinary interest in her facial appearance and physical
well-being, an interest not at all borne out rationally by
her looks. Much to her father’s and his sister’s astonishment,
she began to paint and primp in front of her mirror
nearly all day long. Lip sticks, rouge, eyebrow pencils,
perfumes, rings, pins, combs, and what not else, were suddenly
introduced—very expensive and disconcerting lingerie,
for one thing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</span></p>

<p>“The family had always maintained a charge account at
at least two of the larger stores of the city, and to these she
had recently repaired, as it was discovered afterwards, and
indulged herself, without a by-your-leave, in all these things.
High-heeled slippers, bright-colored silk stockings, hats,
blouses, gloves, furs, to say nothing of accentuated and even
shocking street costumes, began to arrive in bundles. Since
the father was out most of the day and the elderly aunt busy
with household affairs, nothing much of all this was noted,
until later she began to adorn herself in this finery and to
walk the streets in it. And then the due bills, sixty days
late; most disturbing but not to be avoided. And so came
the storm.</p>

<p>“The father and aunt, who had been wondering where
these things were coming from, became very active and opposed.
For previous to this, especially in the period of her
greatest depression, Marguerite had apparently dressed with
no thought of anything, save a kind of resigned willingness
to remain inconspicuous, as much as to say: ‘What difference
does it make. No one is interested in me.’ Now, however,
all this had gone—quite. She had supplied herself with hats
so wide and ‘fancy’ or ‘fixy,’ as her father said, that they were
a disgrace. And clothing so noticeable or ‘loud’—I forget
his exact word—that any one anywhere would be ashamed
of her. There were, as I myself saw when I was eventually
called in as specialist in the case, too many flowers, too much
lace, too many rings, pins and belts and gewgaws connected
with all this, which neither he nor his sister was ever quite
able to persuade her to lay aside. And the colors! Unless
she were almost forcibly restrained, these were likely to be
terrifying, even laughter-provoking, especially to those accustomed
to think of unobtrusiveness as the first criterion of
taste—a green or red or light blue broad-trimmed hat, for
instance, with no such color of costume to harmonize with
it. And, whether it became her or not, a white or tan or
green dress in summertime, or one with too much red or
too many bright colors in winter. And very tight, worn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</span>
with a dashing manner, mayhap. Even high-heeled slippers
and thin lacy dresses in bitter windy weather. And the perfumes
with which she saturated herself were, as her father
said, impossible—of a high rate of velocity, I presume.</p>

<p>“So arrayed, then, she would go forth, whenever she
could contrive it, to attend a theatre, a lecture, a moving
picture, or to walk the streets. And yet, strangely enough,
and this was as curious a phase of the case as any, she never
appeared to wish to thrust her personal charms, such as
they were, on any one. On the contrary, as it developed,
there had generated in her the sudden hallucination that she
possessed so powerful and self-troubling a fascination for
men that she was in danger of bewildering them, enticing
them against themselves to their moral destruction, as well
as bringing untold annoyance upon herself. A single glance,
one look at her lovely face, and presto! they were enslaved.
She needed but to walk, and lo! beauty—her beauty, dazzling,
searing, destroying—was implied by every motion,
gesture. No man, be he what he might, could withstand
it. He turned, he stared, he dreamed, he followed her and
sought to force his attention on her. Her father explained
to me that when he met her on the street one day he was
shocked to the point of collapse. A daughter of his so
dressed, and on the street! With the assistance of the
maiden sister a number of modifications was at once brought
about. All charge accounts were cancelled. Dealers were
informed that no purchases of hers would be honored unless
with the previous consent of her father. The worst of her
sartorial offenses were unobtrusively removed from her room
and burnt or given away, and plainer and more becoming
things substituted.</p>

<p>“But now, suddenly, there developed a new and equally interesting
stage of the case. Debarred from dressing as she
would, she began to imagine, as these two discovered, that she
was being followed and admired and addressed and annoyed
by men, and that at her very door. Eager and dangerous admirers
lurked about the place. As the maiden aunt once informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</span>
me, having wormed her way into Marguerite’s confidence,
she had been told that men ‘were wild’ about her and
that go where she would, and conduct herself however
modestly and inconspicuously, still they were inflamed.</p>

<p>“A little later both father and sister began to notice that
on leaving the house or returning to it she would invariably
pause, if going out, to look about first; if returning, to look
back as though she were expecting to see some one outside
whom she either did or did not wish to see. Not infrequently
her comings-in were accompanied by something like flight,
so great a need to escape some presumably dangerous or at
least impetuous pursuer as to cause astonishment and even
fear for her. There would be a feverish, fumbled insertion
of the key from without, after which she would fairly jump
in, at the same time looking back with a nervous, perturbed
glance. Once in she would almost invariably pause and look
back as though, having succeeded in eluding her pursuer,
she was still interested to see what he was like or what he
was doing, often going to the curtained windows of the front
room to peer out. And to her then confidante, this same
aunt, she explained on several occasions that she had ‘just
been followed again’ all the way from Broadway or Central
Park West or somewhere, sometimes by a most wonderful-looking
gentleman, sometimes by a most loathsome brute.
He had seen her somewhere and had pursued her to her
very room. Yet, brute or gentleman, she was always interested
to look back.</p>

<p>“When her father and aunt first noted this manifestation
they had troubled to inquire into it, looking into the street
or even going so far as to go to the door and look for the
man, but there was no one, or perchance some passing pedestrian
or neighbor who most certainly did not answer to the
description of either handsome gentleman or brute. Then
sensibly they began to gather that this was an illusion. But
by now the thing had reached a stage where they began to
feel genuine alarm. Guests of the family were accused by
her of attempting to flirt with her, of making appealing remarks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</span>
to her as they entered, and neighbors of known polarity
and conventional rigidity of presuming to waylay her and
forcing her to listen to their pleas. Thus her father and aunt
became convinced that it was no longer safe for her to be
at large. The family’s reputation was at stake; its record
for freedom from insanity about to be questioned.</p>

<p>“In due time, therefore, I was sent for, and regardless of
how much they dreaded a confession of hallucination here
the confession was made to me. I was asked to say what if
anything could be done for her, and if nothing, what was to
be done with her. After that I was permitted to talk to
Marguerite whom of course I had long known, but not as a
specialist or as one called in for advice. Rather, I was
presented to her as visiting again as of yore, having dropped
in after a considerable absence. She seemed pleased to see
me, only as I noticed on this, as on all subsequent occasions,
she seemed to wish, first, not to stay long in my presence and
more interesting still, as I soon noted, to wish to keep her
face, and even her profile, averted from me, most especially
her eyes and her glances. Anywhere, everywhere, save at
me she looked, and always with the purpose, as I could see, of
averting her glances.</p>

<p>“After she had left the room I found that this development
was new to the family. They had not noticed it before,
and then it struck me as odd. I suspected at once that
there was some connections between this and her disappointed
love life. The devastating effect of lack of success in love in
youth had been too much for her. So this averted glance appeared
to me to have something to do with that. Fearing to
disturb or frighten her, and so alienate her, I chose to say
nothing but instead came again and again in order to
familiarize her with my presence, to cause her once more to
take it as a matter of course. And to enlist her interest
and sympathy, I pretended that there was a matter of taxes
and some involved property that her father was helping
me to solve.</p>

<p>“And in order to insure her presence I came as a rule just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</span>
before dinner, staying some little time and talking with her.
To guarantee being alone with her I had her father and his
sister remain out for a few minutes after I arrived, so as
to permit me to seem to wait. And on these occasions I
invented all sorts of excuses for coming into conversation
with her. On all of these visits I noticed that she still kept
her face from me. Having discussed various things with her,
I finally observed: ‘I notice, Marguerite, that whenever I
come here now you never look at me. Don’t you like me?
You used to look at me, and now you keep your face turned
away. Why is that?’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, of course I like you, doctor, of course,’ she replied,
‘only,’ she paused, ‘well, I’ll tell you how it is: I don’t want
to have the same effect on you that I do on other men.’”</p>

<p>“She paused and I stared, much interested. ‘I’m afraid I
don’t quite understand, Marguerite,’ I said.</p>

<p>“‘Well, you see, it’s this way,’ she went on, ‘it’s my
beauty. All you men are alike you see: you can’t stand it.
You would be just the same as the rest. You would be
wanting to flirt with me, too, and it wouldn’t be your fault,
but mine. You can’t help it. I know that now. But I
don’t want you to be following me like the rest of them, and
you would be if I looked at you as I do at the others.’ She
had on at the time a large hat, which evidently she had been
trying on before I came, and now she pulled it most coquettishly
low over her face and then sidled, laughingly, out
of the room.</p>

<p>“When I saw and heard this,” he went on, “I was deeply
moved instead of being amused as some might imagine, for I
recognized that this was an instance of one of those kindly
compensations in nature about which I have been talking,
some deep inherent wish on the part of some overruling
Providence perhaps to make life more reasonably endurable
for all of us. Here was this girl, sensitive and seeking, who
had been denied everything—or, rather, the one thing she
most craved in life; love. For years she had been compelled
to sit by and see others have all the attention and pleasures,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</span>
while she had nothing—no pleasures, no lovers. And because
she had been denied them their import had been
exaggerated by her; their color and splendor intensified.
She had been crucified, after a fashion, until beauty and
attention were all that her mind cried for. And then, behold
the mercy of the forces about which we are talking! They
diverted her mind in order to save her from herself. They
appeared at last to preserve her from complete immolation,
or so I see it. Life does not wish to crucify people, of
that I am sure. It lives on itself—as we see,—is “red of
beak and claw” as the phrase has it—and yet, in the deep,
who knows there may be some satisfactory explanation for
that too—who can tell? At any rate, as I see it basically,
fundamentally, it is well-intentioned. Useless, pointless
torture had no real place in it; or at least so I think.” He
paused and stared, as though he had clinched his argument.</p>

<p>“Just the same, as you say,” I insisted, “it does live on
itself, the slaughter houses, the stockyards, the butcher shops,
the germs that live and fatten as people die. If you can get
much comfort out of these you are welcome.”</p>

<p>He paid no attention to me. Instead, he went on: “This
is only a theory of mine, but we know, for instance, that
there is no such thing as absolute evil, any more than there
is absolute good. There is only relative evil and relative
good. What is good for or to me may be evil to you, and
vice versa, like a man who may be evil to you and good
to me.</p>

<p>“In the case of this girl I cannot believe that so vast a
thing as life, involving as it does, all the enormous forces and
complexities, would single out one little mite such as she
deliberately and specially for torture. On the contrary, I
have faith to believe that the thing is too wise and grand for
that. But, according to my theory, the machinery for creating
things may not always run true. A spinner of plans or
fabrics wishes them to come forth perfect of course, arranges
a design and gathers all the colors and threads for a flawless
result. The machine may be well oiled. The engine perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</span>
geared. Every precaution taken, and yet in the
spinning here and there a thread will snap, the strands become
entangled, bits, sometimes whole segments spoiled by
one accident and another, but not intentionally. On the
other hand, there are these flaws, which come from where
I know not, of course, but are accidental, I am sure, not
intended by the spinner. At least I think so. They cause
great pain. They cause the worst disasters. Yet our great
mother, Nature, the greatest spinner of all, does what she
can to right things—or so I wish to believe. Like the
spinner himself, she stops the machine, unites the broken
strands, uses all her ability to make things run smoothly
once more. It is my wish to believe that in this case, where
a homely girl could not be made into a beautiful one and
youth could not be substituted for maturity, still nature
brought about what I look upon as a beneficent illusion, a
providential hallucination. Via insanity, Marguerite attained
to all the lovely things she had ever longed for. In
her unreason she had her beautiful face, her adoring cavaliers—they
turned and followed her in the streets. She was
beautiful to all, to herself, and must hide her loveliness in
order to avert pain and disaster to others. How would you
explain that? As reasoned and malicious cruelty on the
part of nature. Or as a kindly intervention, a change of
heart, a wish on the part of nature or something to make
amends to her for all that she suffered, not to treat her or
any of us too brutally or too unfairly? Or just accident?
How?”</p>

<p>He paused once more and gazed at me, as much as to say:
“Explain that, if you can.” I, in turn, stared, lost for the
time being in thoughts of this girl, for I was greatly impressed.
This picture of her, trying, in her deranged imaginings
as to her beauty, to protect others from herself,
turning her face away from those who might suffer because
of her indifference, because she in her day had suffered from
the indifference of others, finding in hallucination, in her
jumbled fancies, the fulfilment of all her hopes, her dreams,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</span>
was too sad. I was too sad. I could not judge, and did not.
Truly, truly, I thought, I wish I might believe.</p>

THE PRINCE WHO WAS A THIEF</h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Improvisation on the Oldest Oriental Theme</span></h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> doors of the mosque in Hodeidah stood wide and
inviting after the blaze of an Arabian afternoon. And
within, the hour of prayer having drawn nigh, were prostrated
a few of the more faithful, their faces toward Mecca.
Without, upon the platform of the great mosque and within
the shadow of the high east wall, a dozen mendicants in
their rags were already huddled or still arranging themselves,
in anticipation of the departure of those of the faithful who
might cast them a pice or an anna, so plain is the prescription
of the Koran. For is it not written: “And forget not the
poor, and the son of the road”? Even so, praise be to Allah,
the good, the great.</p>

<p>Apart from them, oblivious of them and their woes, even
of the import of the mosque itself, a score or more of Arabian
children were at play, circling about like knats or bats. And
passing among these or idling in groups for a word as to the
affairs of the day, were excellent citizens of Hodeidah, fresh
from their shops and errands—Bhori, the tin-seller, for one,
making his way before going home to a comfortable mabraz,
there to smoke a water-pipe and chew a bit of khat; and
Ahmed, the carpet-weaver, stopping at the mosque to pray
before going home; and Chudi, the baker, and Zad-el-Din,
the seller of piece goods, whose shops were near together,
both fathers, these, and discussing trade and the arrival of
the camel train from Taif. And now came Azad Bakht, the
barber, mopping his brow as was his wont. And Feruz, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</span>
water-carrier, to offer water for sale. And many others
came and went, for this was the closing hour of the shops;
soon all would be making for home or the mabrazes after a
moment of prayer in the mosque, so near is the hereafter to
the now.</p>

<p>But Gazzar-al-Din, a mendicant story-teller, fresh from
the camel train out of Taif which within the hour had passed
beyond the Chedar gate, was not one of these. Indeed he
was a stranger in Hodeidah, one of those who make their
way from city to city and village to village by their skill as
tellers of tales, reciters of the glories of kings and princesses
and princes and the doings of Jinn and magicians and fabled
celebrities generally. Yet poor was he indeed. His tales he
had gathered on many travels. And though nearing the age
of eighty and none too prepossessing of mien, yet so artful
was he in the manner of presenting his wares that he had not
thus far died of want. His garb was no more than a loincloth,
a turban and a cape as dirty as they were ragged. His
beard and hair had not for years known any other comb than
the sands of the desert and the dust of the streets. His face
was parchment, his hands claws, one arm was withered.</p>

<p>Taking in at a glance the presence of a score of comrades
in misery at or near the mosque door, Gazzar-al-Din betook
himself to a respectful distance and surveyed the world in
which he found himself. The cook-shop of Al Hadjaz being
not far off and some inviting fragrance therefrom streaming
to him on the wind, he made shift to think how he could
best gather an audience of all who now came and went so
briskly. For eat he must. No doubt there were many in
Hodeidah who told tales, and by those about the mosque who
sought alms certainly an additional seeker would not be welcomed.
Indeed there had been times when open hostility
had been manifested, as in Feruz where, after gathering
many anna from an admiring throng, once he had been set
upon and beaten, his purse taken, and, to crown it all, a
pail of slops cast upon him by a savage she-wolf of their
pack. It behooved him therefore to have a care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</span></p>

<p>Still, all things considered, it was not so poor a life.
Many had their homes, to be sure, and their wives and
shops, but were there not drawbacks? The best of them
were as fixed as the palms and sands of the desert. Once in
their lives perhaps they had journeyed to Mecca or Medina,
to be preyed upon and swindled, in some instances even to be
murdered, by the evil hawks that dwelt there. But in his
case now.... The fragrances from the shop of Al Hadjaz
renewed themselves.... There was nothing for it: he
must find a comfortable doorway or the shaded side of a
wall where he could spread his cape, belabor his tambour and
so attract attention and secure as many anna as might be
before he began to unfold such a tale of adventure and
surprise as would retain the flagging interest of the most
wearied and indifferent. And eventually secure him sufficient
anna for his meal and lodging. But to do that, as he
well knew, there must be in it somewhere, a beautiful princess
and a handsome lover; also a noble and generous and
magnificent caliph. And much talk to be sure of gold and
power where so little existed in real life. In addition there
should be cruel robbers and thieves, and, also, a righteous
man too—though in real life, how few. Sometimes as the
faces of those addressed showed a wane of interest it was
wise to take apart and recombine many tales, borrow from
one to bolster up another.</p>

<p>As he walked, looking at the windows and doors of all the
shops and residences about him, he eventually spied a deep
recess giving into the closed market a score of feet from the
public square. Here he seated himself and began softly to
thump his tambour, lest those religiously minded should take
offense. Also it was no part of his desire to attract the
mendicants, who were still before the door of the mosque.
Soon they might depart, and then he would feel safer, for in
them, especially for such as he—a fellow craftsman, as it
were—was nothing but jibes and rivalry. He drummed
softly, looking briskly about the while, now at the windows,
now toward the mosque, now along the winding street.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</span>
Seeing two urchins, then a third, pause and gaze, he reasoned
that his art was beginning to lure. For where children
paused, their elders were sure to follow. And so it proved.
Drawing nearer and nearer these first children were joined
by a fourth, a fifth, a sixth. Presently Haifa, the tobacco
vendor, limping toward the mosque to sell his wares, paused
and joined the children. He was curious as to what was to
follow—whether Gazzar would secure an audience. Next
came Waidi, the water-seller, fresh from a sale; then Ajeeb,
ne’er-do-well cleaner of market stalls for the merchants, and
full of curiosity ever. And after him came Soudi and Parfi,
carriers, an appetite for wonders besetting them; and then
El-Jed, the vendor of kindling.</p>

<p>As they gathered about him Gazzar-al-Din ventured to
thrum louder and louder, exclaiming: “A marvelous tale,
O Company of the Faithful! A marvelous tale! Hearken!
A tale such as has never yet been told in all Hodeidah—no,
not in all Yemen! ‘A Prince Who was a Thief.’ A Prince
Who Was a Thief! For a score of anna—yea, the fourth
part of a rupee—I begin. And ah, the sweetness of it! As
jasmine, it is fragrant; as khat, soothing. A marvelous
tale!”</p>

<p>“Ay-ee, but how is one to know that,” observed Ahmed,
the carpet-weaver, to Chudi, the tailor, with whom he had
drawn near. “There are many who promise excellent tales
but how few who tell them.”</p>

<p>“It is even as thou sayst, O Ahmed. Often have I
hearkened and given anna in plenty, yet few there are whose
tales are worth the hearing.”</p>

<p>“Why not begin thy tale, O Kowasji?” inquired Soudi,
the carrier. “Then if, as thou sayst, it is so excellent, will
not anna enough be thine? There are tellers of tales, and
tellers of tales—”</p>

<p>“Yea, and that I would,” replied the mendicant artfully,
“were all as honest as thou lookest and as kind. Yet have I
traveled far without food, and I know not where I may rest
this night.... A tale of the great caliph and the Princess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</span>
Yanee and the noble Yussuf, stolen and found again. And
the great treasury sealed and guarded, yet entered and robbed
by one who was not found. Anna—but a score of anna, and
I begin! What? Are all in Hodeidah so poor that a tale
of love and pleasure and danger and great palaces and great
princes and caliphs and thieves can remain untold for the
want of a few anna—for so many as ten dropped into my
tambour? A marvelous tale! A marvelous tale!”</p>

<p>He paused and gazed speculatively about, holding out his
tambour. His audience looked dubiously and curiously at
him; who now was this latest teller of wonders, and from
whence had he come? An anna was not much, to be sure,
and a tale well told—well—yet there had been tellers of
such whose tales were as dull as the yawn of a camel.</p>

<p>“An excellent tale, sayst thou?” queried Parfi cautiously.
“Then, if it be so marvelous, why not begin? For a handful
of anna one may promise anything.”</p>

<p>“A great promiser there was here once,” commented Ajeeb,
the gossip, sententiously, “and he sat himself in this self-same
door. I remember him well. He wore a green turban,
but a greater liar there never was. He promised wonders
and terrors enough, but it came to nothing—not a demon
or Jinn in it.”</p>

<p>“Is it of demons and Jinns only that thou thinkest, donkey?”
demanded Haifa. “Verily, there are wonders and
mysteries everywhere, without having them in tales.”</p>

<p>“Yea, but a tale need not be for profit, either,” said Waidi,
the water-seller. “It is for one’s leisure, at the end of a day.
I like such as end happily, with evil punished and the good
rewarded.”</p>

<p>“Come, O friends,” insisted Gazzar-al-Din, seeing that
one or two were interested, “for a score of anna I begin.
Of Yemen it is, this very Yemen, and Baghdad, once a
greater city than any to-day—”</p>

<p>“Begin then,” said Azad Bakht, the barber. “Here is an
anna for thee,” and he tossed a coin in the tambour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</span></p>

<p>“And here is another for thee,” observed Haifa, fishing in
his purse. “I do not mind risking it.”</p>

<p>“And here is another,” called Soudi condescendingly.
“Begin.”</p>

<p>“And here is yet another,” added Parfi grandiosely.
“Now, then, thy tale, and look thee that it is as thou sayst,
marvelous.” And they squatted about him on the ground.</p>

<p>But Gazzar, determined not to begin until he had at least
ten anna, the price of a bowl of curds and a cup of kishr,
waited until he had accumulated so many, as well as various
“Dogs!” and “Pigs!” and “Wilt thou begin, miser, or wilt
thou fill thy tambour?” into the bargain. He then crouched
upon his rags, lifted his hand for silence, and began:</p>

<p>“Know then, O excellent citizens of Hodeidah, that once,
many years since, there lived in this very Yemen where now
is Taif, then a much more resplendent city, a sultan by the
name of Kar-Shem, who had great cities and palaces and an
army, and was beloved of all over whom he ruled. When
he—wilt thou be seated, O friend? And silence!—when he
was but newly married and ruling happily a son was born
to him, Hussein, an infant of so great charm and beauty that
he decided he should be carefully reared and wisely trained
and so made into a fit ruler for so great a country. But,
as it chanced, there was a rival or claimant to this same
throne by another line, a branch long since deposed by the
ancestors of this same king, and he it was, Bab-el-Bar by
name, who was determined that the young Prince Hussein
should be stolen and disposed of in some way so that he
should never return and claim the throne. One day, when
the prince was only four years of age, the summer palace was
attacked and the princeling captured. From thence he was
carried over great wastes of sand to Baghdad, where he was
duly sold as a slave to a man who was looking for such, for
he was a great and successful thief, one who trained thieves
from their infancy up so that they should never know what
virtue was.”</p>

<p>“Ay-ee, there are such,” interrupted Ahmed, the carpet-weaver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</span>
loudly, for his place had only recently been robbed.
“I know of the vileness of thieves.”</p>

<p>“Peace! Peace!” insisted Waidi and Haifa sourly.</p>

<p>Gazzar-al-Din paused until quiet should be restored, then
resumed:</p>

<p>“Once the Prince Hussein was in the hands of this thief,
he was at once housed with those who stole, who in turn
taught him. One of the tricks which Yussuf, the master
thief, employed was to take each of his neophytes in turn at
the age of seven, dress him in a yarn jacket, lower him into a
dry cistern from which there was no means of escape, place
a large ring-cake upon a beam across the top and tell him to
obtain the cake or starve. Many starved for days and were
eventually dismissed as unworthy of his skill. But when the
young Prince Hussein was lowered he meditated upon his
state. At last he unraveled a part of his yarn jacket, tied a
pebble to it and threw it so that it fell through the hole of
the cake, and thus he was able to pull it down. At this
Yussuf was so pleased that he had him drawn up and given
a rare meal.</p>

<p>“One day Yussuf, hearing good reports from those who
were training Hussein in thieving, took him to the top of a
hill traversed by a road, where, seeing a peasant carrying a
sheep on his back approaching, Yussuf Ben Ali asked of
Hussein, now renamed Abou so that he might not be found:
‘How shall we get the sheep without the peasant learning
that we have taken it?’ Trained by fear of punishment to
use his wits, Abou, after some thought replied: ‘When thou
seest the sheep alone, take it!’ Stealing from the thicket, he
placed one of his shoes in the road and then hid. The
peasant came and saw the shoe, but left it lying there because
there was but one. Abou ran out and picked up the shoe,
reappearing from the wood far ahead of the peasant where
he put down the mate to the first shoe and then hid again.
The peasant came and examined the shoe, then tied his
sheep to a stake and ran back for the first one. Yussuf, seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</span>
the sheep alone, now came out and hurried off with it,
while Abou followed, picking up the last shoe.”</p>

<p>“He was a donkey to leave his sheep in the road,” interpolated
Parfi, the carrier, solemnly.</p>

<p>“But more of a donkey not to have taken up the first
shoe,” added Soudi.</p>

<p>“Anna! Anna!” insisted Gazzar-al-Din, seizing upon this
occasion to collect from those who had newly arrived. “’Tis
a marvellous tale! Remember the teller of good tales, whose
gift it is to sweeten the saddest of days. He lightens the
cares of those who are a-weary. Anna! Anna!” And with
a clawy hand he held out the tambour to Zad-el-Din and
Azad Bakht, who began to regret their interest.</p>

<p>“Cannot a man speak without thou demandest anna?”
grumbled Zad-el-Din, fishing in his purse and depositing an
anna, as did Azad Bakht and several more. Whereupon,
the others beginning to grumble, Gazzar continued:</p>

<p>“The peasant coming back to where he had seen the first
shoe and not finding it, was dazed and ran back to his sheep,
to find that that and the second shoe were gone. Yussuf
was much pleased and rewarded Abou with a new coat
later, but for the present he was not done. Judging by long
experience that the peasant had either bought the sheep and
was taking it home or that he was carrying it to market to
sell, he said to Abou: ‘Let us wait. It may be that he will
return with another.’”</p>

<p>“Ah, shrewd,” muttered Ajeeb, nodding his head gravely.
“Accordingly,” went on Gazzar-al-Din, “they waited and
soon the peasant returned carrying another sheep. Yussuf
asked Abou if he could take this one also, and Abou told
him that when he saw the sheep alone to take it.”</p>

<p>“Dunce!” declared Chudi, the baker. “Will he put another
sheep down after just losing one? This is a thin
tale!” But Gazzar was not to be disconcerted.</p>

<p>“Now Yussuf was a great thief,” he went on, “but this
wit of Abou’s puzzled him. Of all the thieves he had trained
few could solve the various problems which he put before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</span>
them, and in Abou he saw the makings of a great thief.
As the peasant approached, Abou motioned to Yussuf to
conceal himself in a crevice in the nearby rocks, while he
hid in the woods. When the peasant drew near Abou
placed his hands to his lips and imitated a sheep bleating,
whereupon the peasant, thinking it must be his lost sheep,
put down behind a stone the one he was carrying, for
its feet were tied, and went into the woods to seek the lost
one. Yussuf, watching from his cave, then ran forth and
made off with the sheep. When the peasant approached,
Abou climbed a tree and smiled down on him as he sought
his sheep, for he had been taught that to steal was clever and
wise, and the one from whom he could steal was a fool.”</p>

<p>“And so he is,” thought Waidi, who had stolen much in
his time.</p>

<p>“When the peasant had gone his way lamenting, Abou
came down and joined Yussuf. They returned to the city
and the home of Yussuf, where the latter, much pleased,
decided to adopt Abou as his son.” Gazzar now paused
upon seeing the interest of his hearers and held out his
tambour. “Anna, O friends, anna! Is not the teller of
tales, the sweetener of weariness, worthy of his hire? I have
less than a score of anna, and ten will buy no more than a
bowl of curds or a cup of kishr, and the road I have traveled
has been long. So much as the right to sleep in a stall with
the camels is held at ten anna, and I am no longer young.”
He moved the tambour about appealingly.</p>

<p>“Dog!” growled Soudi. “Must thy tambour be filled
before we hear more?”</p>

<p>“Bismillah! This is no story-teller but a robber,” declared
Parfi.</p>

<p>“Peace, friends,” said Gazzar, who was afraid to irritate
his hearers in this strange city. “The best of the tale comes
but now—the marvelous beauty of the Princess Yanee and
the story of the caliph’s treasury and the master thief. But,
for the love of Allah, yield me but ten more anna and I pause
no more. It is late. A cup of kishr, a camel’s stall—” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</span>
waved the tambour. Some three of his hearers who had not
yet contributed anything dropped each an anna into his
tambour.</p>

<p>“Now,” continued Gazzar somewhat gloomily, seeing how
small were his earnings for all his art, “aside from stealing
and plundering caravans upon the great desert, and the
murdering of men for their treasure, the great Yussuf conducted
a rug bazaar as a blind for more thievery and murder.
This bazaar was in the principal street of the merchants,
and at times he was to be seen there, his legs crossed upon
his pillows. But let a merchant of wealth appear, a stranger,
and although he might wish only to ask prices Yussuf would
offer some rug or cloth so low that even a beggar would wish
to take it. When the stranger, astonished at its price, would
draw his purse a hand-clap from Yussuf would bring forth
slaves from behind hangings who would fall upon and bind
him, take his purse and clothes and throw his body into the
river.”</p>

<p>“An excellent robber indeed!” approved Soudi.</p>

<p>“Yussuf, once he had adopted Abou as his son, admitted
him to his own home, where were many chambers and a
garden, a court with a pool, and many servants and cushions
and low divans in arcades and chambers; then he dressed
him in silks and took him to his false rug market, where he
introduced him with a great flourish as one who would
continue his affairs after he, Yussuf, was no more. He called
his slaves and said: ‘Behold thy master after myself. When
I am not here, or by chance am no more—praise be to Allah,
the good, the great!—see that thou obey him, for I have
found him very wise.’ Soon Yussuf disguised himself as a
dervish and departed upon a new venture. As for Abou,
being left in charge of the rug market, he busied himself
with examining its treasures and their values and thinking on
how the cruel trade of robbery, and, if necessary, murder,
which had been taught him, and how best it was to be conducted.</p>

<p>“For although Abou was good and kind of heart, still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</span>
being taken so young and sharply trained in theft and all
things evil, and having been taught from day to day that
not only were murder and robbery commendable but that
softness or error in their pursuit was wrong and to be severely
punished, he believed all this and yet innocently
enough at times sorrowed for those whom he injured. Yet
also he knew that he durst not show his sorrow in the
presence of Yussuf, for the latter, though kind to him, was
savage to all who showed the least mercy or failed to do his
bidding, even going so far as to slay them when they sought
to cross or betray him.”</p>

<p>“Ay-ee, a savage one was that,” muttered Al Hadjaz, the
cook.</p>

<p>“And I doubt not there are such in Yemen to this day,”
added Ajeeb, the cleaner of stalls. “Was not Osman
Hassan, the spice-seller, robbed and slain?”</p>

<p>“Soon after Yussuf had left on the secret adventure, there
happened to Abou a great thing. For it should be known
that at this time there ruled in Baghdad the great and wise
Yianko I., Caliph of the Faithful in the valleys of the
Euphrates and the Tigris and master of provinces and
principalities, and the possessor of an enormous treasury of
gold, which was in a great building of stone. Also he possessed
a palace of such beauty that travelers came from many
parts and far countries to see. It was built of many-colored
stones and rare woods, and possessed walks and corridors and
gardens and flowers and pools and balconies and latticed
chambers into which the sun never burst, but where were
always cool airs and sweet. Here were myrtle and jasmine
and the palm and the cedar, and birds of many colors, and
the tall ibis and the bright flamingo. It was here, with his
many wives and concubines and slaves and courtiers, and
many wise men come from far parts of the world to advise
with him and bring him wisdom, that he ruled and was
beloved and admired.</p>

<p>“Now by his favorite wife, Atrisha, there had been born
to him some thirteen years before the beautiful and tender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</span>
and delicate and loving and much-beloved Yanee, the sweetest
and fairest of all his daughters, whom from the very first
he designed should be the wife of some great prince, the
mother of beautiful and wise children, and the heir, through
her husband, whoever he should be, to all the greatness and
power which the same must possess to be worthy of her.
And also, because he had decided that whoever should be wise
and great and deserving enough to be worthy of Yanee
should also be worthy of him and all that he possessed—the
great Caliphate of Baghdad. To this end, therefore, he
called to Baghdad instructors of the greatest wisdom and
learning of all kinds, the art of the lute and the tambour
and the dance. And from among his wives and concubines
he had chosen those who knew most of the art of dress and
deportment and the care of the face and the body; so that
now, having come to the age of the ripest perfection, thirteen,
she was the most beautiful of all the maidens that had appeared
in Arabia or any of the countries beyond it. Her
hair was as spun gold, her teeth as pearls of the greatest
price, lustrous and delicate; her skin as the bright moon
when it rises in the east, and her hands and feet as petals
in full bloom. Her lips were as the pomegranate when it is
newly cut, and her eyes as those deep pools into which the
moon looks when it is night.”</p>

<p>“Yea, I have heard of such, in fairy-tales,” sighed Chudi,
the baker, whose wife was as parchment that has cracked
with age.</p>

<p>“And I, behind the walls of palaces and in far cities, but
never here,” added Zad-el-Din, for neither his wife nor his
daughters was any too fair to look upon. “They come not
to Hodeidah.”</p>

<p>“Ay-ee, were any so beautiful,” sighed Al Tadjaz, “there
would be no man worthy. But there are none.”</p>

<p>“Peace!” cried Ahmed. “Let us have the tale.”</p>

<p>“Yea, before he thinks him to plead for more anna,” muttered
Hadjaz, the sweeper, softly.</p>

<p>But Gazzar, not to be robbed of this evidence of interest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</span>
was already astir. Even as they talked he held out the tambour,
crying: “Anna, anna, anna!” But so great was the
opposition that he dared not persist.</p>

<p>“Dog!” cried Waidi. “Wilt thou never be satisfied?
There is another for thee, but come no more.”</p>

<p>“Thou miser!” said Haifa, still greatly interested, “tell
thy tale and be done!”</p>

<p>“The thief has rupees and to spare, I warrant,” added
Scudi, contributing yet another anna.</p>

<p>And Zad-el-Din and Ahmed, because they were lustful
of the great beauty of Yanee, each added an anna to his
takings.</p>

<p>“Berate me not, O friends,” pleaded Gazzar tactfully,
hiding his anna in his cloak, “for I am as poor as thou seest—a
son of the road, a beggar, a wanderer, with nowhere to
lay my head. Other than my tales I have nothing.” But
seeing scant sympathy in the faces of his hearers, he resumed.</p>

<p>“Now at the time that Abou was in charge of the dark
bazaar it chanced that the caliph, who annually arranged for
the departure of his daughter for the mountains which are
beyond Azol in Bactria, where he maintained a summer
palace of great beauty, sent forth a vast company mounted
upon elephants and camels out of Ullar and Cerf and horses
of the rarest blood from Taif. This company was caparisoned
and swathed in silks and thin wool and the braided
and spun cloth of Esher and Bar with their knitted threads
of gold. And it made a glorious spectacle indeed, and all
paused to behold. But it also chanced that as this cavalcade
passed through the streets of Baghdad, Abou, hearing a great
tumult and the cries of the multitude and the drivers and the
tramp of the horses’ feet and the pad of the camels’, came to
the door of his bazaar, his robes of silk about him, a turban
of rare cloth knitted with silver threads upon his head. He
had now grown to be a youth of eighteen summers. His
hair was as black as the wing of the duck, his eyes large and
dark and sad from many thoughts as is the pool into which
the moon falls. His face and hands were tinted as with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</span>
henna when it is spread very thin, and his manners were
graceful and languorous. As he paused within his doorway
he looked wonderingly at the great company as it moved and
disappeared about the curves of the long street. And it
could not but occur to him, trained as he was, how rich
would be the prize could one but seize upon such a company
and take all the wealth that was here and the men and
women as slaves.</p>

<p>“Yet, even as he gazed and so thought, so strange are the
ways of Allah, there passed a camel, its houdah heavy
with rich silks, and ornaments of the rarest within, but
without disguised as humble, so that none might guess. And
within was the beautiful Princess Yanee, hidden darkly
behind folds of fluttering silk, her face and forehead covered
to her starry eyes, as is prescribed, and even these veiled.
Yet so strange are the ways of life and of Allah that, being
young and full of the wonder which is youth and the
curiosity and awe which that which is unknown or strange
begets in us all, she was at this very moment engaged in
peeping out from behind her veils, the while the bright
panorama of the world was passing. And as she looked,
behold, there was Abou, gazing wonderingly upon her fine
accoutrements. So lithe was his form and so deep his eyes
and so fair his face that, transfixed as by a beam, her heart
melted and without thought she threw back her veil and
parted the curtains of the houdah the better to see, and the
better that he might see. And Abou, seeing the curtains put
to one side and the vision of eyes that were as pools and the
cheeks as the leaf of the rose shine upon him, was transfixed
and could no longer move or think.</p>

<p>“So gazing, he stood until her camel and those of many
others had passed and turned beyond a curve of the street.
Then bethinking himself that he might never more see her,
he awoke and ran after, throwing one citizen and another to
the right and the left. When at last he came up to the
camel of his fair one, guarded by eunuchs and slaves, he drew
one aside and said softly: ‘Friend, be not wrathful and I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</span>
will give thee a hundred dinars in gold do thou, within such
time as thou canst, report to me at the bazaar of Yussuf, the
rug-merchant, who it is that rides within this houdah. Ask
thou only for Abou. No more will I ask.’ The slave, noting
his fine robes and the green-and-silver turban, thought him
to be no less than a noble, and replied: ‘Young master, be not
overcurious. Remember the vengeance of the caliph....
‘Yet dinars have I to give.’... ‘I will yet come to thee.’</p>

<p>“Abou was enraptured by even so little as this, and yet
dejected also by the swift approach and departure of joy.
‘For what am I now?’ he asked himself. ‘But a moment
since, I was whole and one who could find delight in all
things that were given me to do; but now I am as one who
is lost and knows not his way.’”</p>

<p>“Ay-ee,” sighed Azad Bakht, the barber, “I have had that
same feeling more than once. It is something that one may
not overcome.”</p>

<p>“Al Tzoud, in the desert—” began Parfi, but he was
interrupted by cries of “Peace—Peace!”</p>

<p>“Thereafter, for all of a moon,” went on Gazzar, “Abou
was as one in a dream, wandering here and there drearily,
bethinking him how he was ever to know more of the face
that had appeared to him through the curtains of the houdah.
And whether the driver of the camel would ever return. As
day after day passed and there was no word, he grew thin
and began to despair and to grow weary of life. At last
there came to his shop an aged man, long of beard and dusty
of garb, who inquired for Abou. And being shown him said:
‘I would speak with thee alone.’ And when Abou drew
him aside he said: ‘Dost thou recall the procession of the
caliph’s daughter to Ish-Pari in the mountains beyond Azol?’
And Abou answered, ‘Ay, by Allah!’ ‘And dost thou recall
one of whom thou madest inquiry?’ ‘Aye,’ replied Abou,
vastly stirred. ‘I asked who it was that was being borne
aloft in state.’ ‘And what was the price for that knowledge?’
‘A hundred dinars.’ ‘Keep thy dinars—or, better
yet, give them to me that I may give them to the poor, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</span>
I bring thee news. She who was in the houdah was none
other than the Princess Yanee, daughter of the caliph and
heir to all his realm. But keep thou thy counsel and all
thought of this visit and let no one know of thy inquiry.
There are many who watch, and death may yet be thy
portion and mine. Yet, since thou art as thou art, young
and without knowledge of life, here is a spray of the myrtles
of Ish-Pari—but thou art to think no further on anything
thou hast seen or heard. And thou dost not—death!’ He
made the sign of three fingers to the forehead and the neck
and gave Abou the spray, receiving in return the gold.”</p>

<p>“Marhallah!” cried Soudi. “How pleasant it is to think
of so much gold!”</p>

<p>“Yea,” added Haifa, “there is that about great wealth and
beauty and comfort that is soothing to the heart of every
man.”</p>

<p>“Yet for ten more anna,” began Gazzar, “the price of a
bed in the stall of a camel, how much more glorious could I
make it—the sweetness of the love that might be, the wonder
of the skill of Abou—anna, anna—but five more, that I may
take up this thread with great heart.”</p>

<p>“Jackal!” screamed Ajeeb fiercely. “Thou barkst for but
one thing—anna. But now thou saidst if thou hadst but ten
more, and by now thou hast a hundred. On with thy tale!”</p>

<p>“Reremouse!” said Chudi. “Thou art worse than thy
Yussuf himself!” And none gave an anna more.</p>

<p>“Knowing that the myrtle was from the princess,” went
on Gazzar wearily, “and that henceforth he might seek but
durst not even so much as breathe of what he thought or
knew, he sighed and returned to his place in the bazaar.</p>

<p>“But now, Yussuf, returning not long after from a far
journey, came to Abou with a bold thought. For it related
to no other thing than the great treasury of the caliph,
which stood in the heart of the city before the public market,
and was sealed and guarded and built of stone and carried
the wealth of an hundred provinces. Besides, it was now
the time of the taking of tithes throughout the caliphate, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</span>
Yussuf knew, and the great treasury was filled to the roof,
or so it was said, with golden dinars. It was a four-square
building of heavy stone, with lesser squares superimposed
one above the other after the fashion of pyramids. On each
level was a parapet, and upon each side of every parapet as
well as on the ground below there walked two guards, each
first away from the centre of their side to the end and then
back, meeting at the centre to reverse and return. And on
each side and on each level were two other guards. No two
of these, of any level or side, were permitted to arrive at
the centre or the ends of their parapet at the same time, as
those of the parapets above or below, lest any portion of the
treasury be left unguarded. There was but one entrance,
which was upon the ground and facing the market. And
through this no one save the caliph or the caliph’s treasurer
or his delegated aides might enter. The guards ascended
and descended via a guarded stair. “Anna, O friends,”
pleaded Gazzar once more, “for now comes the wonder of
the robbing of the great treasury—the wit and subtlety of
Abou—and craft and yet confusion of the treasurer and the
Caliph—anna!—A few miserable anna!”</p>

<p>“Jackal!” shouted Azad Bakht, getting up. “Thou robbest
worse than any robber! Hast thou a treasury of thine
own that thou hopest to fill?”</p>

<p>“Give him no more anna,” called Feruz stoutly. “There
is not an anna’s worth in all his maunderings.”</p>

<p>“Be not unkind, O friends,” pleaded Gazzar soothingly.
“As thou seest, I have but twenty annas—not the price of a
meal, let alone of a bed. But ten—but—five—and I
proceed.”</p>

<p>“Come, then, here they are,” cried Al Hadjaz, casting
down four; and Zad-el-Din and Haifa and Chudi each likewise
added one, and Gazzar swiftly gathered them up and
continued:</p>

<p>“Yussuf, who had long contemplated this wondrous storehouse,
had also long racked his wits as to how it might be
entered and a portion of the gold taken. Also he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</span>
counseled with many of his pupils, but in vain. No one had
solved the riddle for him. Yet one day as he and Abou
passed the treasury on their way to the mosque for the look
of honor, Yussuf said to Abou: ‘Bethink thee, my son; here
is a marvelous building, carefully constructed and guarded.
How wouldst thou come to the store of gold within?’ Abou,
whose thoughts were not upon the building but upon Yanee,
betrayed no look of surprise at the request, so accustomed
was he to having difficult and fearsome matters put before
him, but gazed upon it so calmly that Yussuf exclaimed:
‘How now? Hast thou a plan?’ ‘Never have I given it a
thought, O Yussuf,’ replied Abou; ‘but if it is thy wish, let
us go and look more closely.’</p>

<p>“Accordingly, through the crowds of merchants and
strangers and donkeys and the veiled daughters of the harem
and the idlers generally, they approached and surveyed it.
At once Abou observed the movement of the guards, saw
that as the guards of one tier were walking away from each
other those of the tiers above or below were walking toward
each other. And although the one entrance to the treasury
was well guarded still there was a vulnerable spot, which
was the crowning cupola, also four-square and flat, where
none walked or looked. ‘It is difficult,’ he said after a time,
‘but it can be done. Let me think.’</p>

<p>“Accordingly, after due meditation and without consulting
Yussuf, he disguised himself as a dispenser of fodder for
camels, secured a rope of silk, four bags and an iron hook.
Returning to his home he caused the hook to be covered with
soft cloth so that its fall would make no sound, then fastened
it to one end of the silken cord and said to Yussuf: ‘Come
now and let us try this.’ Yussuf, curious as to what Abou
could mean, went with him and together they tried their
weight upon it to see if it would hold. Then Abou, learning
by observation the hour at night wherein the guards were
changed, and choosing a night without moon or stars, disguised
himself and Yussuf as watchmen of the city and went
to the treasury. Though it was as well guarded as ever they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</span>
stationed themselves in an alley nearby. And Abou, seeing
a muleteer approaching and wishing to test his disguise,
ordered him away and he went. Then Abou, watching the
guards who were upon the ground meet and turn, and seeing
those upon the first tier still in the distance but pacing
toward the centre, gave a word to Yussuf and they ran
forward, threw the hook over the rim of the first tier and
then drew themselves up quickly, hanging there above the
lower guards until those of the first tier met and turned.
Then they climbed over the wall and repeated this trick
upon the guards of the second tier, the third and fourth,
until at last they were upon the roof of the cupola where
they lay flat. Then Abou, who was prepared, unscrewed
one of the plates of the dome, hooked the cord over the side
and whispered: ‘Now, master, which?’ Yussuf, ever cautious
in his life, replied: ‘Go thou and report.’</p>

<p>“Slipping down the rope, Abou at last came upon a great
store of gold and loose jewels piled in heaps, from which he
filled the bags he had brought. These he fastened to the
rope and ascended. Yussuf, astounded by the sight of so
much wealth, was for making many trips, but Abou, detecting
a rift where shone a star, urged that they cease for the
night. Accordingly, after having fastened these at their
waists and the plate to the roof as it had been, they descended
as they had come.”</p>

<p>“A rare trick,” commented Zad-el-Din.</p>

<p>“A treasury after mine own heart,” supplied Al Hadjaz.</p>

<p>“Thus for three nights,” continued Gazzar, fearing to
cry for more anna, “they succeeded in robbing the treasury,
taking from it many thousands of dinars and jewels. On
the fourth night, however, a guard saw them hurrying away
and gave the alarm. At that, Abou and Yussuf turned here
and there in strange ways, Yussuf betaking himself to his
home, while Abou fled to his master’s shop. Once there
he threw off the disguise of a guard and reappeared as an
aged vendor of rugs and was asked by the pursuing guards
if he had seen anybody enter his shop. Abou motioned them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</span>
to the rear of the shop, where they were bound and removed
by Yussuf’s robber slaves. Others of the guards, however,
had betaken themselves to their captain and reported, who
immediately informed the treasurer. Torches were brought
and a search made, and then he repaired to the caliph. The
latter, much astonished that no trace of the entrance or
departure of the thieves could be found, sent for a master
thief recently taken in crime and sentenced to be gibbeted,
and said to him:</p>

<p>“‘Wouldst thou have thy life?’</p>

<p>“‘Aye, if thy grace will yield it.’</p>

<p>“‘Look you,’ said the caliph. ‘Our treasury has but now
been robbed and there is no trace. Solve me this mystery
within the moon, and thy life, though not thy freedom, is
thine.’</p>

<p>“‘O Protector of the Faithful,’ said the thief, ‘do thou
but let me see within the treasury.’</p>

<p>“And so, chained and in care of the treasurer himself and
the caliph, he was taken to the treasury. Looking about him
he at length saw a faint ray penetrating through the plate
that had been loosed in the dome.</p>

<p>“‘O Guardian of the Faithful,’ said the thief wisely and
hopefully, ‘do thou place a cauldron of hot pitch under this
dome and then see if the thief is not taken.’</p>

<p>“Thereupon the caliph did as advised, the while the treasury
was resealed and fresh guards set to watch and daily
the pitch was renewed, only Abou and Yussuf came not.
Yet in due time, the avarice of Yussuf growing, they chose
another night in the dark of the second moon and repaired
once more to the treasury, where, so lax already had become
the watch, they mounted to the dome. Abou, upon removing
the plate, at once detected the odor of pitch and
advised Yussuf not to descend, but he would none of this.
The thought of the gold and jewels into which on previous
nights he had dipped urged him, and he descended. However,
when he neared the gold he reached for it, but instead
of gold he seized the scalding pitch, which when it burned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</span>
caused him to loose his hold and fall. He cried to Abou:
‘I burn in hot pitch. Help me!’ Abou descended and
took the hand but felt it waver and grow slack. Knowing
that death was at hand and that should Yussuf’s body be
found not only himself but Yussuf’s wife and slaves would
all suffer, he drew his scimitar, which was ever at his belt,
and struck off the head. Fastening this to his belt, he reascended
the rope, replaced the plate and carefully made his
way from the treasury. He then went to the house of
Yussuf and gave the head to Yussuf’s wife, cautioning her
to secrecy.</p>

<p>“But the caliph, coming now every day with his treasurer
to look at the treasury, was amazed to find it sealed and yet
the headless body within. Knowing not how to solve the
mystery of this body, he ordered the thief before him, who
advised him to hang the body in the market-place and set
guards to watch any who might come to mourn or spy.
Accordingly, the headless body was gibbeted and set up in
the market-place where Abou, passing afar, recognized it.
Fearing that Mirza, the wife of Yussuf, who was of the
tribe of the Veddi, upon whom it is obligatory that they
mourn in the presence of the dead, should come to mourn
here, he hastened to caution her. ‘Go thou not thither,’
he said; ‘or, if thou must, fill two bowls with milk and go
as a seller of it. If thou must weep drop one of the bowls
as if by accident and make as if thou wept over that.’ Mirza
accordingly filled two bowls and passing near the gibbet
in the public square dropped one and thereupon began
weeping as her faith demanded. The guards, noting her,
thought nothing—‘for here is one,’ said they, ‘so poor that
she cries because of her misfortune.’ But the caliph, calling
for the guards at the end of the day to report to himself and
the master thief, inquired as to what they had seen. ‘We
saw none,’ said the chief of the guard, ‘save an old woman
so poor that she wept for the breaking of a bowl!’ ‘Dolts!’
cried the master thief. ‘Pigs! Did I not say take any who
came to mourn? She is the widow of the thief. Try again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</span>
Scatter gold pieces under the gibbet and take any that touch
them.’</p>

<p>“The guards scattered gold, as was commanded, and
took their positions. Abou, pleased that the widow had
been able to mourn and yet not be taken, came now to see
what more might be done by the caliph. Seeing the gold he
said: ‘It is with that he wishes to tempt.’ At once his pride
in his skill was aroused and he determined to take some of
the gold and yet not be taken. To this end he disguised
himself as a ragged young beggar and one weak of wit, and
with the aid of an urchin younger than himself and as
wretched he began to play about the square, running here
and there as if in some game. But before doing this he had
fastened to the sole of his shoes a thick gum so that the
gold might stick. The guards, deceived by the seeming
youth and foolishness of Abou and his friend, said: ‘These
are but a child and a fool. They take no gold.’ But by
night, coming to count the gold, there were many pieces
missing and they were sore afraid. When they reported to
the caliph that night he had them flogged and new guards
placed in their stead. Yet again he consulted with the master
thief, who advised him to load a camel with enticing riches
and have it led through the streets of the city by seeming
strangers who were the worse for wine. ‘This thief who
eludes thee will be tempted by these riches and seek to rob
them.’</p>

<p>“Soon after it was Abou, who, prowling about the market-place,
noticed this camel laden with great wealth and led by
seeming strangers. But because it was led to no particular
market he thought that it must be of the caliph. He decided
to take this also, for there was in his blood that which sought
contest, and by now he wished the caliph, because of Yanee,
to fix his thought upon him. He filled a skin with the best
of wine, into which he placed a drug of the dead Yussuf’s
devising, and dressing himself as a shabby vendor, set forth.
When he came to the street in which was the camel and saw
how the drivers idled and gaped, he began to cry, ‘Wine for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</span>
a para! A drink of wine for a para!’ The drivers drank
and found it good, following Abou as he walked, drinking
and chaffering with him and laughing at his dumbness, until
they were within a door of the house of Mirza, the wife of
the dead Yussuf, where was a gate giving into a secret court.
Pausing before this until the wine should take effect, he
suddenly began to gaze upward and then to point. The
drivers looked but saw nothing. And the drug taking effect
they fell down; whereupon Abou quickly led the camel into
the court and closed the gate. When he returned and
found the drivers still asleep he shaved off half the hair of
their heads and their beards, then disappeared and changed
his dress and joined those who were now laughing at the
strangers in their plight, for they had awakened and were
running here and there in search of a camel and its load and
unaware of their grotesque appearance. Mirza, in order to
remove all traces, had the camel killed and the goods distributed.
A careful woman and housewifely, she had caused
all the fat to be boiled from the meat and preserved in jars,
it having a medicinal value. The caliph, having learned
how it had gone with his camel, now meditated anew on
how this great thief, who mocked him and who was of great
wit, might be taken. Calling the master thief and others in
council he recited the entire tale and asked how this prince
of thieves might be caught. ‘Try but one more ruse, O
master,’ said the master thief, who was now greatly shaken
and feared for his life. ‘Do thou send an old woman from
house to house asking for camel’s grease. Let her plead that
it is for one who is ill. It may be that, fearing detection,
the camel has been slain and the fat preserved. If any is
found, mark the door of that house with grease and take all
within.’</p>

<p>“Accordingly an old woman was sent forth chaffering of
pain. In due time she came to the house of Mirza, who gave
her of the grease, and when she left she made a cross upon
the door. When she returned to the caliph he called his
officers and guards and all proceeded toward the marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</span>
door. In the meantime Abou, having returned and seen the
mark, inquired of Mirza as to what it meant. When told
of the old woman’s visit he called for a bowl of the camel’s
grease and marked the doors in all the nearest streets. The
caliph, coming into the street and seeing the marks, was
both enraged and filled with awe and admiration for of such
wisdom he had never known. ‘I give thee thy life,’ he said
to the master thief, ‘for now I see that thou art as nothing
to this one. He is shrewd beyond the wisdom of caliphs and
thieves. Let us return,’ and he retraced his steps to the
palace, curious as to the nature and soul of this one who
could so easily outwit him.</p>

<p>“Time went on and the caliph one day said to his vizier:
‘I have been thinking of the one who robbed the treasury and
my camel and the gold from under the gibbet. Such an one
is wise above his day and generation and worthy of a better
task. What think you? Shall I offer him a full pardon so
that he may appear and be taken—or think you he will appear?’
‘Do but try it, O Commander of the Faithful,’ said
the vizier. A proclamation was prepared and given to the
criers, who announced that it was commanded by the caliph
that, should the great thief appear on the market-place at a
given hour and yield himself up, a pardon full and free
would be granted him and gifts of rare value heaped upon
him. Yet it was not thus that the caliph intended to do.</p>

<p>“Now, Abou, hearing of this and being despondent over
his life and the loss of Yanee and the death of Yussuf and
wishing to advantage himself in some way other than by
thievery, bethought him how he might accept this offer of
the caliph and declare himself and yet, supposing it were a
trap to seize him, escape. Accordingly he awaited the time
prescribed, and when the public square was filled with
guards instructed to seize him if he appeared he donned
the costume of a guard and appeared among the soldiers
dressed as all the others. The caliph was present to witness
the taking, and when the criers surrounding him begged
the thief to appear and be pardoned, Abou called out from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</span>
the thick of the throng: ‘Here I am, O Caliph! Amnesty!’
Whereupon the caliph, thinking that now surely he would
be taken, cried: ‘Seize him! Seize him!’ But Abou, mingling
with the others, also cried: ‘Seize him! Seize him!’
and looked here and there as did the others. The guards,
thinking him a guard, allowed him to escape, and the caliph,
once more enraged and chagrined, retired. Once within
his chambers he called to him his chief advisers and had
prepared the following proclamation:</p>
<br>

<p class="center no-indent">“‘BE IT KNOWN TO ALL</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Since within the boundaries of our realm there
exists one so wise that despite our commands and best
efforts he is still able to work his will against ours and
to elude our every effort to detect him, be it known that
from having been amazed and disturbed we are now
pleased and gratified that one so skilful of wit and
resourceful should exist in our realm. To make plain
that our appreciation is now sincere and our anger
allayed it is hereby covenant with him and with all
our people, to whom he may appeal if we fail in our
word, that if he will now present himself in person and
recount to one whom we shall appoint his various adventures,
it will be our pleasure to signally distinguish
him above others. Upon corroboration by us of that
which he tells, he shall be given riches, our royal
friendship and a councillor’s place in our council. I
have said it.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘<span class="smcap">Yianko I.</span>’<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>“This was signed by the caliph and cried in the public
places. Abou heard all but because of the previous treachery
of the caliph he was now unwilling to believe that this was
true. At the same time he was pleased to know that he was
now held in great consideration, either for good or ill, by
the caliph and his advisers, and bethought him that if it were
for ill perhaps by continuing to outwit the caliph he might
still succeed in winning his favor and so to a further knowledge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</span>
of Yanee. To this end he prepared a reply which he
posted in the public square, reading:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center no-indent">“‘PROCLAMATION BY THE ONE WHOM<br>
THE CALIPH SEEKS</p>

<p>“‘Know, O Commander of the Faithful, that the
one whom the caliph seeks is here among his people free
from harm. He respects the will of the caliph and his
good intentions, but is restrained by fear. He therefore
requests that instead of being commanded to reveal
himself the caliph devise a way and appoint a time
where in darkness and without danger to himself he
may behold the face of the one to whom he is to reveal
himself. It must be that none are present to seize him.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘<span class="smcap">The One Whom the Caliph Seeks.</span>’<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>“Notice of this reply being brought to the caliph he forthwith
took counsel with his advisers and decided that since it
was plain the thief might not otherwise be taken, recourse
must be had to a device that might be depended upon to
lure him. Behind a certain window in the palace wall
known as ‘The Whispering Window,’ and constantly used
by all who were in distress or had suffered a wrong which
owing to the craft of others there was no hope of righting,
sat at stated times and always at night, the caliph’s own
daughter Yanee, whose tender heart and unseeking soul were
counted upon to see to it that the saddest of stories came to
the ears of the caliph. It was by this means that the caliph
now hoped to capture the thief. To insure that the thief
should come it was publicly announced that should any one
that came be able to tell how the treasury had been entered
and the gold pieces taken from under the gibbet or the camel
stolen and killed, he was to be handed a bag of many dinars
and a pardon in writing; later, should he present himself,
he would be made a councillor of state.</p>

<p>“Struck by this new proclamation and the possibility of
once more beholding the princess, Abou decided to match his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</span>
skill against that of the caliph. He disguised himself as a
vendor of tobacco and approached the window, peered
through the lattice which screened it and said: ‘O daughter
of the great caliph, behold one who is in distress. I am he
whom the caliph seeks, either to honor or slay, I know not
which. Also I am he who, on one of thy journeys to the
mountain of Azol and thy palace at Ish-Pari thou beheldest
while passing the door of my father’s rug-market, for thou
didst lift the curtains of thy houdah and also thy veil and
didst deign to smile at me. And I have here,’ and he touched
his heart, ‘a faded spray of the myrtles of Ish-Pari, or so it
has been told me, over which I weep.’</p>

<p>“Yanee, shocked that she should be confronted with the
great thief whom her father sought and that he should claim
to be the beautiful youth she so well remembered, and yet
fearing this to be some new device of the vizier or of the
women of the harem, who might have heard of her strange
love and who ever prayed evil against all who were younger
or more beautiful than they, she was at a loss how to proceed.
Feeling the need of wisdom and charity, she said:
‘How sayst thou? Thou are the great thief whom my father
seeks and yet the son of a rug-merchant on whom I smiled?
Had I ever smiled on a thief, which Allah forbid, would I
not remember it and thee? Therefore, if it be as thou
sayst, permit it that I should have a light brought that
I may behold thee. And if thou art the rug-merchant’s son
or the great thief, or both, and wishest thy pardon and the
bag of dinars which here awaits thee, thou must relate to
me how it was the treasury was entered, how the gold was
taken from under the gibbet and my father’s camel from its
drivers.’ ‘Readily enough, O Princess,’ replied Abou, ‘only
if I am thus to reveal myself to thee must I not know first
that thou art the maiden whom I saw? For she was kind
as she was fair and would do no man an ill. Therefore if
thou wilt lower thy veil, as thou didst on the day of thy
departure, so that I may see, I will lift my hood so that
thou mayst know that I lie not.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</span></p>

<p>“The princess, troubled to think that the one whom she
had so much admired might indeed be the great thief whose
life her father sought, and yet wavering between duty to her
father and loyalty to her ideal, replied: ‘So will I, but upon
one condition: should it be that thou art he upon whom thou
sayst I looked with favor and yet he who also has committed
these great crimes in my father’s kingdom, know that thou
mayst take thy pardon and thy gold and depart; but only
upon the condition that never more wilt thou trouble either
me or my father. For I cannot bear to think that I have
looked with favor upon one who, however fair, is yet a thief.’</p>

<p>“At this Abou shrank inwardly and a great sorrow fell
upon him; for now, as at the death of Yussuf, he saw again
the horror of his way. Yet feeling the justice of that which
was said, he answered: ‘Yea, O Princess, so will I, for I
have long since resolved to be done with evil, which was not
of my own making, and will trouble thee no more. Should
this one glance show me that beloved face over which I have
dreamed, I will pass hence, never more to return, for I will
not dwell in a realm where another may dwell with thee
in love. I am, alas, the great thief and will tell thee how
I came by the gold under the gibbet and in thy father’s
treasury; but I will not take his gold. Only will I accept
his pardon sure and true. For though born a thief I am no
longer one.’ The princess, struck by the nobility of these
words as well as by his manner, said sadly, fearing the light
would reveal the end of her dreams: ‘Be it so. But if thou
art indeed he thou wilt tell me how thou camest to be a
thief, for I cannot believe that one of whom I thought so
well can do so ill.’</p>

<p>“Abou, sadly punished for his deeds, promised, and when
the torch was brought the princess lifted her veil. Then it
was that Abou again saw the face upon which his soul had
dwelt and which had caused him so much unrest. He was
now so moved that he could not speak. He drew from his
face its disguise and confronted her. And Yanee, seeing for
the second time the face of the youth upon whom her memory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</span>
had dwelt these many days, her heart misgave her and
she dared not speak. Instead she lowered her veil and sat
in silence, the while Abou recounted the history of his
troubled life and early youth, how he could recall nothing
of it save that he had been beaten and trained in evil ways
until he knew naught else; also of how he came to rob the
treasury, and how the deeds since of which the caliph complained
had been in part due to his wish to protect the widow
of Yussuf and to defeat the skill of the caliph. The princess,
admiring his skill and beauty in spite of his deeds, was at a
loss how to do. For despite his promise and his proclamation,
the caliph had exacted of her that in case Abou appeared
she was to aid in his capture, and this she could not do.
At last she said: ‘Go, and come no more, for I dare not
look upon thee, and the caliph wishes thee only ill. Yet let
me tell my father that thou wilt trouble him no more,’ to
which Abou replied: ‘Know, O Princess, thus will I do.’
Then opening the lattice, Yanee handed him the false pardon
and the gold, which Abou would not take. Instead he
seized and kissed her hand tenderly and then departed.</p>

<p>“Yanee returned to her father and recounted to him the
story of the robbery of the treasury and all that followed,
but added that she had not been able to obtain his hand in
order to have him seized because he refused to reach for the
gold. The caliph, once more chagrined by Abou’s cleverness
in obtaining his written pardon without being taken, now
meditated anew on how he might be trapped. His daughter
having described Abou as both young and handsome, the
caliph thought that perhaps the bait of his daughter might
win him to capture and now prepared the following and
last pronunciamento, to wit:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center no-indent">“‘TO THE PEOPLE OF BAGHDAD</p>

<p>“‘Having been defeated in all our contests with the
one who signs himself <em>The One Whom the Caliph
Seeks</em>, and yet having extended to him a full pardon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</span>
signed by our own hand and to which has been affixed
the caliphate seal, we now deign to declare that if this
wisest of lawbreakers will now present himself in person
before us and accept of us our homage and good
will, we will, assuming him to be young and of agreeable
manners, accept him as the affiant of our daughter
and prepare him by education and training for her
hand; or, failing that, and he being a man of mature
years, we will publicly accept him as councillor of state
and chiefest of our advisers. To this end, that he may
have full confidence in our word, we have ordered that
the third day of the seventh moon be observed as a
holiday, that a public feast be prepared and that our
people assemble before us in our great court. Should
this wisest of fugitives appear and declare himself we
will there publicly reaffirm and do as is here written
and accept him into our life and confidence. I have
said it.</p>

<p class="right">
“‘<span class="smcap">Yianko I.</span>’<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>“The caliph showed this to his daughter and she sighed,
for full well she knew that the caliph’s plan would prove
vain—for had not Abou said that he would return no more?
But the caliph proceeded, thinking this would surely bring
about Abou’s capture.</p>

<p>“In the meantime in the land of Yemen, of which Abou
was the rightful heir, many things had transpired. His
father, Kar-Shem, having died and the wretched pretender,
Bab-el-Bar, having failed after a revolution to attain to
Kar-Shem’s seat, confessed to the adherents of Kar-Shem
the story of the Prince Hussein’s abduction and sale into
slavery to a rug-merchant in Baghdad. In consequence,
heralds and a royal party were at once sent forth to discover
Hussein. They came to Baghdad and found the widow of
Yussuf, who told them of the many slaves Yussuf had
owned, among them a child named Hussein to whom they
had given the name of Abou.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</span></p>

<p>“And so, upon Abou’s return from ‘The Whispering
Window,’ there were awaiting him at the house of Mirza
the representatives of his own kingdom, who, finding him
young and handsome and talented, and being convinced by
close questioning that he was really Hussein, he was apprised
of his dignity and worth and honored as the successor
of Kar-Shem in the name of the people of Yemen.</p>

<p>“And now Hussein (once Abou), finding himself thus
ennobled, bethought him of the beautiful Yanee and her
love for him and his undying love for her. Also he felt
a desire to outwit the caliph in one more contest. To this
end he ordered his present entourage to address the caliph
as an embassy fresh from Yemen, saying that having long
been in search of their prince they had now found him, and
to request of him the courtesy of his good-will and present
consideration for their lord. The caliph, who wished always
to be at peace with all people, and especially those of
Yemen, who were great and powerful, was most pleased at
this and sent a company of courtiers to Hussein, who now
dwelt with his entourage at one of the great caravanseries
of the city, requesting that he come forthwith to the palace
that he might be suitably entertained. And now Abou,
visiting the caliph in his true figure, was received by him
in great state, and many and long were the public celebrations
ordered in his honor.</p>

<p>“Among these was the holiday proclaimed by Yianko in
order to entrap Abou. And Yianko, wishing to amuse and
entertain his guest, told him the full history of the great
thief and of his bootless efforts thus far to take him. He
admitted to Hussein his profound admiration for Abou’s
skill and ended by saying that should any one know how
Abou might be taken he would be willing to give to that
one a place in his council, or, supposing he were young and
noble, the hand of his daughter. At this Hussein, enticed
by the thought of so winning Yanee, declared that he himself
would attempt to solve the mystery and now prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</span>
to appear as a fierce robber, the while he ordered one of his
followers to impersonate himself as prince for that day.</p>

<p>“The great day of the feast having arrived and criers
having gone through the streets of the city announcing the
feast and the offer of the caliph to Abou, there was much
rejoicing. Long tables were set in the public square, and
flags and banners were strung. The beautiful Yanee was
told of her father’s vow to Hussein, but she trusted in Abou
and his word and his skill and so feared naught. At last,
the multitude having gathered and the caliph and his courtiers
and the false Hussein having taken their places at the
head of the feast, the caliph raised his hand for silence.
The treasurer taking his place upon one of the steps leading
to the royal board, reread the proclamation and called upon
Abou to appear and before all the multitude receive the
favor of the caliph or be forever banned. Abou, or Hussein,
who in the guise of a fierce mountain outlaw had mingled
with the crowd, now came forward and holding aloft the
pardon of the caliph announced that he was indeed the thief
and could prove it. Also, that as written he would exact
of the caliph his daughter’s hand. The caliph, astounded
that one so uncouth and fierce-seeming should be so wise as
the thief had proved or should ask of him his daughter’s
hand, was puzzled and anxious for a pretext on which he
might be restrained. Yet with all the multitude before him
and his word given, he scarce knew how to proceed or what
to say. Then it was that Yanee, concealed behind a lattice,
sent word to her father that this fierce soul was not the one
who had come to her but an impostor. The caliph, now
suspecting treachery and more mischief, ordered this seeming
false Abou seized and bound, whereupon the fictitious
Hussein, masquerading in Hussein’s clothes, came forward
and asked for the bandit’s release for the reason that he was
not a true bandit at all but the true prince, whom they had
sought far and wide.</p>

<p>“Then the true Hussein, tiring of the jest and laying aside
his bandit garb, took his place at the foot of the throne and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</span>
proceeded to relate to Yianko the story of his life. At this
the caliph, remembering his word and seeing in Abou, now
that he was the Prince of Yemen, an entirely satisfactory
husband for Yanee, had her brought forward. Yanee,
astonished and confused at being thus confronted with her
lost love, now become a Prince, displayed so much trepidation
and coquetry that the caliph, interested and amused
and puzzled, was anxious to know the cause. Whereupon
Hussein told how he had seen her passing his robber father’s
bazaar on her way to Ish-Pari and that he had ever since
bemoaned him that he was so low in the scale of life as
not to be able to aspire to her hand yet now rejoiced that
he might make his plea. The caliph, realizing how true a
romance was here, now asked his daughter what might be
her will, to which she coyly replied that she had never been
able to forget Abou. Hussein at once reiterated his undying
passion, saying that if Yanee would accept him for her
husband and the caliph as his son he would there and then
accept her as his queen and that their nuptials should be
celebrated before his return to his kingdom. Whereupon
the caliph, not to be outdone in gallantry, declared that he
would gladly accept so wise a prince, not only as his son by
marriage but as his heir, and that at his death both he and
Yanee were jointly to rule over his kingdom and their own.
There followed scenes of great rejoicing among the people,
and Hussein and Yanee rode together before them.</p>

<p>“And now, O my hearers,” continued Gazzar most artfully,
although his tale was done, “ye have heard how it was
with Abou the unfortunate, who came through cleverness
to nothing but good—a beautiful love, honor and wealth and
the rule of two realms—whereas I, poor wanderer that I
am—”</p>

<p>But the company, judging that he was about to plead for
more anna, and feeling, and rightly, that for so thin a tale
he had been paid enough and to spare, arose and as one man
walked away. Soudi and Parfi denounced him as a thief
and a usurer; and Gazzar, counting his small store of anna<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</span>
and looking betimes at the shop of Al Hadjaz, from which
still came the odors of food, and then in the direction of the
caravan where lay the camels among which he must sleep,
sighed. For he saw that for all his pains he had not more
than the half of a meal and a bed and that for the morrow
there was nothing.</p>

<p>“By Allah,” he sighed, “what avails it if one travel the
world over to gather many strange tales and keep them fresh
and add to them as if by myrrh and incense and the color
of the rose and the dawn, if by so doing one may not come
by so much as a meal or a bed? Bismillah! Were it not
for my withered arm no more would I trouble to tell a tale!”
And tucking his tambour into his rags he turned his steps
wearily toward the mosque, where before eating it was, as
the Koran commanded, that he must pray.</p>
